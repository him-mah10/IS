I mean you need to get rid of the watch as it's currently useless to you. I'm willing to give you 130,counter-price
I have to pay for shipping which I would naturally insure it for it's value so I'm firm on $150,counter-price

That wouldn't be good for me because I'm not a rock fan. But it does look very pleasant and it's close to where I work so I'll offer $1100.,counter-price
"Okay, maybe this will sweeten the pot. The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250.",counter-price

Hi I'd like to see if I can negotiate this price. With cost of living increasing it seems like it could be lower and allow me to consider a longer lease.,intro

ok.  will you be able to afford $1998 per person per month?,init-price
"Honestly that amount is a lot more than I'm comfortable with, since I'm on student loans. But since you're willing to change up the lease terms regarding move-in and move-out date, I can be a little flexible. Could you do $7000 from all four of us, per month?",counter-price
I can do $7095 per month and all four of you will have to fill out a rental application.  I will go ahead and waive the $35 credit check for each person.  That will save you all $140 on the application process.,counter-price
sure no problem,disagree
"Hi, any questions about the listing?",intro
"Yes, how old is the lamp?",inquiry
"I received it as a gift recently. It's practically new, as stated in the advert.",inform
What is your asking price?,inquiry
"$80 is a price that is fair and reasonable as I paid quite a bit more for this ruffled lamp. It's stylish, functional and a great deal",init-price
I would be interested at a slightly lower price. I would be happy to come and pick up this item from a place most convenient for you for a small discount of 7 dollars.,counter-price
"I can drop 5 dollars, not a whole 7. I think if I sit on this longer I could probably get my full asking price so if you wanna do a 5 dollar discount we can, otherwise, no.",counter-price
That's a hard bargain. So are you saying you're willing to do a price of $75 on the condition I come to you to pick it up?,counter-price
Exactly. Is $75 good?,agree
"Hm, well I was going to use that extra 2 dollars to buy my wife a very well deserved 10 year anniversary gift. However I think this lamp will make us both happier. I can't let it go. You have a deal!",counter-price
"Hi, I am interested but have afew questions...",intro
is the reserved parking spot covered?,inquiry
yes it is covered by a carport. We also have garages avaliable for an additional fee. The garages are not attached to the apartment itself but they are within the building and have an entryway so you won't have to walk outside in the elements to get to your garage.,disagree
"I just wanted a covered spot, though the garage sounds nice , I am on a budget. I was also curious as to your pet policy..?",inquiry

"I see. well like I said I am interested but on a budget any chance I can get it at a discount, say $1712",counter-price
"I cannot go that low, the lowest I can go is 2100. Did I mention utilities (water, gas, sewer, electricity) are included? We also have all brand new appliances in the our units as well as new flooring throughout.",vague-price
"It all sounds so lovely, anyway you can waive the pet fee if I do it at 2100?",counter-price
I can't waive the deposit but I can spread the deposit out over 1 year making rent $2108.34/month for the first year.,counter-price
I only have one cat.. no way you can do 2100?,insist
oh I realize I didn't even ask what type of animal. I have to keep a deposit in case your cat messes up the apartment. 2101 (making it a $12 deposit spread out over the year),counter-price
"Hey, nice looking bike. WHy are you getting rid of it?",intro
"Well, I just recently moved and I simply don't have time to ride anymore. Sure I'll put on weight and it might ruin my love life but I have a business to run and children to feed.",disagree
I'm asking a list price of 1800 which is a discount from the retail original price. As you can see I've added a few upgrades to the bike as well.,init-price

"If you're willing to come by and pick it up, I'd let it go for $1900.",counter-price
Sure I can do that. Its absolutely not an issue for me! I would definitely accept this offer,disagree
I'm interested in your bike. Can you tell me anything about how long you've had this?,intro
I like it. I really do. But the asking price is up in the clouds. There are many of these bikes in similar condition as low as 650. You even admit in your ad that it's hard to tell what's been remade and what parts are original on this bike. I can afford something closer to the 760 dollar range.,init-price
"Well, I could give it to you for $760 provided you come and get it yourself. Does that seem fair?",counter-price
"Yeah, that absolutely sounds fair. I would be happy to come pick it up for $760. You've got a deal!",agree
"Hello, are you interested in this Cadillac?",intro
Yes. Mechanically is it sound?,inquiry
"Yes, the car is in good shape, but it needs a little work. The engine light is on, and I think it's an 02 sensor.",inform
Are you willing to negotiate on the price?,inquiry
"Well, I priced the car with the consideration that it probably will need around $1,000 dollars worth of work over the next few months, so I think $3600 is a fair price.",init-price
"In the condition it's in and then having an engine issue, that seems really high. Bluebook is showing more like $2000 but that does seem a little low to me. Maybe around $2400?",counter-price
"If you're willing to come pick the car up, I'd go down to $2600",counter-price
That seems fair. I'll go $2600,agree

Does it have scratches and is everything working good and solid on it?,inquiry

I could go $85.00.,counter-price
If I offer to throw in my crazy wife will it help you come up at all in price?,inquiry
No thanks. Just the TV stand at $85.00. You'd have to pay me to take her haha.,insist

It is in great condition. I haven't hardly ridden it which is why I am selling it.,disagree

Are you interested in the house?,intro
I am but was wondering about the location. What is that close to?,inquiry
"This home is located in a great part of town.  It is on a quiet cul de sac, but walking distance to the town center with shops and restaurants.  It is a safe walk too.  Lined with brand-new sidewalks all the way.",inform
I wish you accepted pets and had a washer/dryer. Would you be willing to go $2200?,init-price
"No, sorry, too low.  There is a washer/dryer hook up.",vague-price
I could go $2500 if you can include a washer/dryer but that's the best I can do.,counter-price
"I have a couple coming to view the property today.  If you could do 2800 the property is yours, but otherwise I'll have to wait until after the viewing.",counter-price
I can do $2600 with the washer/dryer but that is a stretch.,counter-price
I have other business to tend to so I'll tell you what...I'll take 2600 but no washer dryer.,agree
$2550 and that will leave me enough to rent a washer/dryer?,counter-price

well these days they call a third party made products oems now. you can never be sure. anyway how about i give you 5 bucks for it?,init-price

"well, they all have on and off buttons now. it's not a big deal. besides we';ve had on and off buttons on things for a century. tell you what, 6 bucks. i come and pick it up. you don't even have to leave your house.",counter-price
Let this incredible headset go at only $6? I couldn't take less than 8.50!,counter-price

"No defects, I don't think I can take $200. What if I deliver it to you, can you come up to $300?",counter-price
If you throw in some knee pads and a helmet I could come up with $240.,counter-price
"Hmm, I do have those and won't have any use for them. $250 with drop off, safety gear and an extra chain I have laying around?",counter-price
Ok. That sounds perfect. $250 will work.,agree
"Hello, yes I am interested in this car.",intro
"Well, are there any problems with the car?",inquiry
"it' a toyota. they don't have problems. i did rebuilt the engine because you know once car go over 150K the engines wear out. but with a rebuilt engine, and manual transmisssion, this car will last you another 100K no problem. you may have to service the clutch once in a while. keep up with the regular maintenance and all that",disagree
"Well, I'd be interested. I'd like to pay $1640.",init-price
geesh man. that's not right. that's literally half the price i'm asking i really can't let go of this car for less than 3000,counter-price

"No, it's purely cosmetic. A fresh coat of paint will fix that right up for you.",disagree
Well it's a little more work than I care to take on. I'd like to get it for $90. I'm probably going to have to take it to a restorer.,counter-price
It really won't need much work at all but I do have some wiggle room. $90 is just too low for the collector's item. I could take $160 for it.,counter-price
I'll bring my offer up to $110 but do you have a helmet I could have. Safety first and all that.,counter-price
Ok. I'll take $110 for and throw in the helmet.,agree

"$350 and it has been checked by the local phone store and I had them set everything back to factory like new. I also have the manuals, a car charger, and earphones that I can put with it.",counter-price
"That's a little steep for me.  If you throw in an otter box (protective casing) and will pay or postage, I will give you $320.",counter-price
I actually had a case for it. It is yellow and I can ship it. That's not a problem. $320 is a great deal for you. I'm sure your teenager will be thrilled.,agree

"How about 750? $25 extra shouldn't be too far of a stretch from your current offer, no?",counter-price

Hi this is a rare screenprint that will be great for any room.,intro

Solid oak so it's well worth the 125 price and I will even include the hardware for that price.,init-price
"That's nice of you, unfortunately I can only afford $95. I will take great care with the piece though and it will be proudly displayed!",counter-price
I could go as low as $100 and that would be a nice chunk still taken off the price which seems fair.,counter-price
Hello!,intro

It rides great. It's in excellent shape and you really can't do any better in terms of reliability than a Canondale,disagree
"Sounds great, I was hoping to shave a bit of cash off the price, would you be willing to go down to around $420?",init-price
"That's a bit low from what I was looking to get. If you're willing to pick it up to save me the hassle of shipping, I could let it go for $525",counter-price
"Thats pretty fair, I could definitely pull the trigger on that if you dropped it down to $500. The location is a bit far out, but I wouldn't mind making the trip.",counter-price

I purchased this dresser for over $1200 less than 3 months ago and never used it. It's market value is much closer to $1200. I think $750 is more than fair.,counter-price
I can offer 500. I will pick up.,counter-price
I can't go that low. I can throw in the liners for the dresser but I have to get $750 for it.,counter-price
What about delivery for $750? I can do $750 IF you can deliver to me.,counter-price

It's not new but it has a solid frame and is great for someone who can't get something new. From a pet and smoke free home. Great deal at just $40 bucks and can help load it up.,init-price
"Could you possibly deliver it to me? $40 seems kind of steep for an older, used couch if I have to pick it up, too. Or maybe you could come down on the price, say $35?",counter-price
35 seems fair and can still help load.,agree
"Hey, I was interested in the kid's bike you have listed for sale. It looks like it's in decent condition, but with you being the second owner and all, $20 seems a little high. Would you consider taking $10?",init-price
"I think the highest I'd be willing to go is $12, but I'll come pick it up myself.",counter-price

How about $175 and I'll include a 32GB Flash card and a new pair of earbuds as well.,counter-price

no i mean it will last you a long time and still be fun,disagree
"Ah, I see. If I were to pick it up from you, would you come down to $86?",init-price

"This one isn't brand new, so I don't see the relevance.",disagree
no it isn't but its a fully functional one with 3 games so i would say ts certainly worth 110 dollars,counter-price

Is there a way to lower the pricing down to around the $1400 - $1600 range?",init-price
"Absolutely, we can do $1,500 with a 1 year lease, or $1,400 with a 2 year lease. Are you interested in either of those options?",counter-price

Well yes selling this.  Bike without much use.  Is certainly a loss for you but i did my reasearch and your exact model and your upgrades have gone down in price when bought brand new now a brand new bike with those up grades would run me about 820 so that would certainly mean your bike value has significantly reduced. If 684 is too low I can do 699 and i will pick it up,counter-price
This bike was only used three times and it has been parked in a garage. It is very clean with many upgraded parts. I could do $790 and I will deliver it to you.,counter-price

"525 for the set with the pillows, I'll bring it down a little, as you seem genuinely interested despite any setbacks.",init-price

I can give $125. You can remove the headset if it even matters?,counter-price

"I'm sorry but that's not a problem, as nobody smokes in the house currently or in the past, so as long as you don't smoke it won't be a problem for your son. I was just letting you know that you are allowed to smoke if you please. The price I can drop down to is going to have to be 2900 at the bare minimum. I hope you understand, I have other clients coming in looking at the place and some have already tried to buy it for around $2600.",counter-price

Lowest I could walk away with is 8200. There aren't too many other vehicles out there in this condition that low.",counter-price

"Well, it's good to hear that you would accept our cat.  And while there is plenty of parking now, we will need at least a spot for each of us.  But how about distance to BART, the transit station? Are you right off Highway 4 or over Willow Pass Road?",inquiry
"Yup, we're very close to Highway 4, so that's convenient, and then in regards to BART I'm not entirely sure, but I can get back to you, I believe we are, sorry about that.",disagree

So both water and electricity are included in the rent?  How about garbage?  And is there a separate fee for using the swimming pool?,inquiry

How about we meet halfway. How's $75,counter-price
I can't meet you halfway since you started so low. That wouldn't be fair at all. I actually already lowered the price to 100 in the first place. So how about 90 and we have a deal.,counter-price

I hope you can forgive me for all the barter, here, because this request in no way is an insult...it's simply that I'm forced to dip into reserves here...  I might be able to scrape up enough to counter with $425...  Again, I wish I could go higher...",counter-price

150k miles. No history of accidents. It's a great little affordable car. I am selling for $3500,init-price
Wow 150k miles is a lot for a jaguar. Does it have any dings or scratches?,inquiry

"Okay seeing that it has such high mileage, even though you say it might last to 200k I think 1500 would be closer to the value of it. How much can you go down?",counter-price
I'd be willing to meet around the middle at 2500,counter-price
"Wow, this all looks really nice!",intro
For sure I can offer you all these chairs at a great low price of 950.00,init-price

That is still a lot. I think we cannot agree. It's been a pleasure though.,disagree

"yes, but most places have at least all needed appliances or include utilities. ill admit the laundry service, pool, and gym are attractive benefits though. how about $1500 to move in-- i could sign the lease this afternoon.",counter-price

Its lited at 350. I an  go to 320,counter-price
Hrm I am a little tight on cash right now. What about 250?,counter-price
280 and its a deal!,counter-price
The phone is unlocked which means if it breaks I am responsible for paying for that or just a new phone. I think cosmetic is going to bother me a little so I will need to buy a new case. And again I am super tight on money and could use a break what do you say 250?,insist

I wish i could. I see similar products on the market for 2500 brand new. 2100 seems like a fair price no?,counter-price
I've put a lot of money and time into making it exactly like this. I'd like to at least break even. It was actually more than 2500 brand new and I've put 1000 into it with the custom parts. So 2100 I'd be loosing a lot.,counter-price

There is a local swimming club that you can buy a membership at a discounted rate since you're a resident of the town.  I believe it's approx. $25 a month last time I checked.",counter-price

If i sighed a year lease and paid for all the rent up front what would you be willing to do?,inquiry
"Well, annual rent at the list price of 2250 would come out to 27000, but if you would be willing to sign the years lease, I could bring it down to about 25200.

"Well, it's worth 20 on the blue book. But at 53k miles, it's been driven about 13k miles a year. That's a bit high. I bet it's due for a fair amount of work so that warranty would be handy. I guess I could do 14500.",counter-price
