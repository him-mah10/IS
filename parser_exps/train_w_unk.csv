Hello...,intro
I am looking for a first floor large 1 bedroom/1bat,unknown
Great. That is what is available. The list price is 1895 and it has a lot of great amenities and is in a really great location.,init-price
I am only looking for a 1bd/1bth. That price is too high for me. I was looking for something under 1200.,counter-price
The price of this 1 bedroom /1 bath is dictated mostly by location unfortunately. But we are willing to negotiate the price a bit.,unknown
How far can you bring the price down? It is not in the center of town. I would still have to take public transportation and also the laundry is not in my unit so that is an additional cost and concern I have to pay.,unknown
"This gated community, with a swimming pool is very ideal. We could loser the price to about 1700 if that would help.",counter-price
The pool and gated community are nice but many communities have that for a lower price and again it does not have private laundry and so I have to pay extra for that as well. The highest I would be willing to pay would be 1400,counter-price
"In order to maintain the security of a gated community and upkeep for things like a swimming pool with a lifeguard on duty, we could not lower the rent by such a large amount. The lowest I could possibly go would be 1600",counter-price

"That's normal, please accept",unknown
"See, I feel like I'm being watched, and whenever I try to make a deal online, it seems to fall through unless I spend a LOT of time negotiating a price, and the details of the trade. I almost feel like I'm expected to spend 5-10 minutes on every trade? Do you ever get that feeling?",inquiry
Not at all.  I suggest you seek help at a mental health professional immediately.  But not before mailing my Ottoman thingy to a neutral address,disagree

Your private entry leads to the apartment above the garage, and the garage gets used every night for some local teens to practice their rock music, so it's like you get a free concert every night :)",counter-price
That wouldn't be good for me because I'm not a rock fan. But it does look very pleasant and it's close to where I work so I'll offer $1100.,counter-price
"Okay, maybe this will sweeten the pot. The shared laundry is only ever used by me, since I live in the main unit, and I only ever use the washing machine to wash my g-strings (I'm a male exotic dancer) so you'll have free reign in the laundry room every weekday. I think that alone is worth $1250.",counter-price
"If you don't mind if I play my collection of barbershop quartet cds rather loudly, so as to help drown out the rock music, I'll consider $1200.",counter-price
"Okay, I'll take that deal.",unknown
Agreed.,unknown

I think I will still need dollars... about 1200 of them...,counter-price
Harrumph. That is a funky discount. Okay just one question: did the garden marry into your family or was it the other way around? Offer coming shortly it's the most I can do and still keep cheese on the table!,unknown

If you can do the gas and electrical I can pay the water and sewer. And if you are amenable to a 3 year lease I would be willing to do $1350.,counter-price
Do you golf? The $1800 also comes with green fees to the golf course. I could take the fees off of the price and go as low as $1450.,counter-price

Let's see what we can do. Where are you coming from? Has your daughter been enrolled in school yet?,inquiry

"It's a little small for what you're asking and there's no warranty on it, would you be willing to take $270 for the table?",init-price
"The price is firm, I have a little wiggle room, but I couldn't go that low. It is well priced for being a handmade piece.",disagree

Hi I'd like to see if I can negotiate this price. With cost of living increasing it seems like it could be lower and allow me to consider a longer lease.,intro

I could do that. We have a deal.,unknown

Oh sorry. I guess I misunderstood that part. I can help deliver it to you.,unknown

Probably. So for 275 I'll deliver it. Sound good?,counter-price

"Definitely! The cottage is in a phenomenal area, and is supposedly haunted by a rich ghost!",unknown

"well a used product can rarely fetch the price paid, I was thinking  $59 and I can come pick it up myself.",init-price
I would consider $75,counter-price
I feel that is too much since it is damaged already and have to try to repaint and repair it.,unknown
The paint is very fresh and does not need a new coat. The price I paid last year was $300 so you are getting it for less than 1/3,counter-price

That shouldn't be an issue as my son has his license. What types of restaurants are near?,unknown
Local favorites such as Primanti Bros. and Peppi's offering sandwiches along with meals. Plenty of seafood choices as well.,unknown

"Today only you get to enjoy a brand new iPhone 6 with 6 gigs. We bought this for our mother but she is too old fashioned, so we got her a flip phone. It is literally almost new",intro

iPhone 6 has so many capabilities and the picture quality is supurb. I can do 290.,counter-price
It's a quality phone without a doubt but that's still a little rich for my blood. If I could get it for 192 that would make me happy. I have cash and can pick it up tonight.,counter-price

Well do you have anything you could throw in to make the 17500 a little more encouraging you have to consider the age and also its lack of use there could be parts that are seezing or rusty. Actually what is the condition of the tires and chain,unknown
I have been riding bikes for several years and I keep this bike in good working order. Since this bike has been upgraded quite a bit I think that would be worth the price since it would keep you from having to upgrade it yourself.,unknown

"Looking online, I saw a few similar products going for $2800. Are you able to do that, as the van is 14 years old",counter-price
"I don't think you can find one in as good a condition as this one that low. I am willing to negotiate, but I don't think I can go that low.",disagree
You want $3500 and I want $2800. How about we meet in the middle and settle for $3150? That way we both get what we want.,counter-price
I think I can work with that. Do you want to come take a look at it?,inquiry
Sure. I will come look at it tomorrow.,inform
cool.,unknown
I am interested in the Curio cabinet.  How many shelves does it have and does the light work?,intro
It has three shelves.,unknown
Are they adjustable or set in place? I have the perfect place for this!,inquiry
One is set in place. Right along the wooden brace there under the knobs. The other two are adjustable.,inform
Awesome!  Is the wood in good condition.  THe picture looks like it is all clear without any blemishes?  Where I would like to put it you would be able to see each side.,unknown
"Yes, the wood is in good condition. It is old but the wood is in good condition.",unknown
"Okay, I would like to offer you $60 cash and I can pick it up within the hour.",init-price
"Since you can get it within the hour, I'll take the 60. Deal.",agree
Make an offer before this one disappears,intro
"So this is a one-bedroom, one bath, right?",inquiry
yes. pool in the complex. newly remodeled,inform
"$1395 -- basically $1400 -- is pretty steep for a one-bedroom, without washer or dryer in-apartment. Coin laundry has a tendency to add up. I've paid $1000 for a one-bedroom in San Francisco, on Nob Hill. I'm pretty sure I could find a two- or three-bedroom for $1400. But, I like the granite kitchen. And the pool is a good perk.",init-price
"Nob Hill isn't very desirable. This one is located near shops, and a bus stop,. it will give you all the convenience you seek. So you need to pay a bit more for that",disagree
"I mean. Nob Hill is right in the middle of town. There was a great bodega right across the street; the BART was a ten-minute walk away. I can go for $1200 on this, all things considered. The perks do push it up a bit.",counter-price
tell you what. sign a one year lease and i'll let you have it for 1250 a month,counter-price
That sounds doable. Let's call it a deal!,unknown
Hello,intro

"Don't have to worry about late nights or problems from me. I'm going to school full time and working 20 hours a week, so won't even be there much. Would you be willing to go down to $1,100?",init-price
"Oh, that sounds like a very busy schedule. With $1100, I don't think I would be able to cover the cost of utilities. Did you see that they were fully included? If you are able to sign a lease today, I could do $1275",counter-price
"I'd be willing to work a few hours of maintenance each week if you could go $1,150. That's as high as I can go.",counter-price
"Can you talk about your maintenance experience? With a full time class load and 20 hours of week elsewhere, what type of time do you think you would have to dedicate to work here?",inquiry
"I've worked for a landscaping company every summer for 4 years. My father is a contractor,  and I've also worked with him.  My job is all weekdays, so my weekends would be open.",inform
"How about 1250. You are responsible for 6 hours of work a month assigned by the property manager. That works out to a rate of about $25.00 discount, but you would be responsible for paying the full balance if you are not able to complete the work. If you are a good employee, I think we could consider additional hours,and further reduction after a trial period.",counter-price
I just don't think I can afford that.,disagree

"I do not have the hardware to do so, but can lower the price by $25 for you to get any hardware. The great thing is that all chairs and cabinets are included. You'd be getting a great deal!",init-price
THat was going to be my next question was if the desk and cabinets were included. Are these hard plastic? The walls look a little flimsy. They're not cardboard are they?,unknown
"They aren't flimsy at all. They are metal with core wood frames, making them last longer than similar products. Absolutely not cardboard! How much are you willing to pay?",unknown
"I was looking for around 250, if possible. I'm willing to go higher if you're able to deliver them. Go even higher if you install. :)",counter-price

Make it 47 and we have a deal,counter-price
Okay. That sounds good to me,unknown
Great. Let me know when you want to pick it up.,unknown

Is it fully functional? Ready to plugin and go?,inquiry
Yep it's in excellent condition,inform

"What does it mean they used them ""for about 6-7""?",inquiry
"oops!  sorry, it's late and I'm trying hard to get these phones sold.  I meant to say they used them for about 6-7 months.",inform
"Ok. Well, I think that those phones probably got a good amount of use in 6-7 months. So, would you be willing to accept a price of $75?",init-price
"No, my parents are both retired and basically used them to call me as I'm an only child and their calls were not that often.  I need to get at least 95 for each phone.",counter-price
"Can you give me free delivery? I'd be willing to do that and pay $95 for each phone, if you can throw in the free delivery. The product is in good shape, after all.",agree

Great!  I hope you enjoy your new phones.,unknown
Hi,intro

I just have had some issues with my camera,unknown
Got it. So what's your favorite thing about this car?,inquiry
"I think the smooth ride and handling, also the color is great , pearl white.",inform
Okay. That's good to hear. What do you think about $5000 even for it. Of course you know that you priced it a bit high.,init-price
I researched and that is more than fair market value. I am willing to lower it but feel 5000 is too low.,agree
"Well, it's a used car without a warranty. I can go a little bit higher than 5k, but I need a warranty.",agree
"you are mistaken, there is a warranty.",unknown
What's the warranty? I don't see it in your advertisement,unknown
"It is a manufacturer warranty, good for 5 more years..",counter-price
"Okay, well in that case, I feel quite a bit better about the fact that there aren't any pictures. How about an even 6000? I am going up a whole thousand more than I want to pay here, please budge for me!!!",counter-price
alright for you I can do 6000.,agree
FANTASTIC!!!,unknown

great! its still avaliable and can be picked up whenever. I'm asking $80 for it.,init-price
do you smoke?,inquiry
"nope, lamp is from a smoke and pet free home",inform
"well that is important, can you tell me what type of silk the shade has on it?",inquiry
teal silk from Italy. I had the lampshade made out of a scarf I bought on a cruise. The lamp itself is less than 3 months old.,inform
that sounds lovely but I am on a budget. I was hoping we could negotiate the price down.,unknown
"I'd be willing to take $60 but I'd have to take the lightbulbs out and replace them with basic bulbs,",counter-price
Could we do 55?,counter-price
sure,unknown
"Hey, can you tell me a little more about the apartment's lease terms? Are they negotiable? I'm a Stanford student and we're on the quarter system, so I would need the lease to continue through the end of June instead of the end of May.",intro
I think we could work something out.  It's only a 30 day extension correct?,inquiry
"Yes, that's correct.",inform
Will you still want to move in August?,inquiry
Could I move in September instead? Our classes don't start until mid-September.,unknown
September 1 to August 31 I could make that work.  Will it be just for yourself?,inquiry
"Awesome. I've got three Stanford friends with me, so they'd be in the other bedrooms and would also move in on September 1.",inform
ok.  will you be able to afford $1998 per person per month?,init-price
"Honestly that amount is a lot more than I'm comfortable with, since I'm on student loans. But since you're willing to change up the lease terms regarding move-in and move-out date, I can be a little flexible. Could you do $7000 from all four of us, per month?",counter-price
I can do $7095 per month and all four of you will have to fill out a rental application.  I will go ahead and waive the $35 credit check for each person.  That will save you all $140 on the application process.,counter-price
Ok that works. Thanks so much.,unknown
sure no problem,disagree
"Hi, any questions about the listing?",intro
"Yes, how old is the lamp?",inquiry
"I received it as a gift recently. It's practically new, as stated in the advert.",inform
What is your asking price?,inquiry
"$80 is a price that is fair and reasonable as I paid quite a bit more for this ruffled lamp. It's stylish, functional and a great deal",init-price
I would be interested at a slightly lower price. I would be happy to come and pick up this item from a place most convenient for you for a small discount of 7 dollars.,counter-price
"I can drop 5 dollars, not a whole 7. I think if I sit on this longer I could probably get my full asking price so if you wanna do a 5 dollar discount we can, otherwise, no.",counter-price
That's a hard bargain. So are you saying you're willing to do a price of $75 on the condition I come to you to pick it up?,counter-price
Exactly. Is $75 good?,agree
"Hm, well I was going to use that extra 2 dollars to buy my wife a very well deserved 10 year anniversary gift. However I think this lamp will make us both happier. I can't let it go. You have a deal!",counter-price
"Hi, I am interested but have afew questions...",intro
sure :),unknown
is the reserved parking spot covered?,inquiry
yes it is covered by a carport. We also have garages avaliable for an additional fee. The garages are not attached to the apartment itself but they are within the building and have an entryway so you won't have to walk outside in the elements to get to your garage.,disagree
"I just wanted a covered spot, though the garage sounds nice , I am on a budget. I was also curious as to your pet policy..?",inquiry
pets are allowed with a $100 deposit for dogs over 40lbs and $50 for cats and small dogs.,init-price
"I see. well like I said I am interested but on a budget any chance I can get it at a discount, say $1712",counter-price
"I cannot go that low, the lowest I can go is 2100. Did I mention utilities (water, gas, sewer, electricity) are included? We also have all brand new appliances in the our units as well as new flooring throughout.",vague-price
"It all sounds so lovely, anyway you can waive the pet fee if I do it at 2100?",counter-price
I can't waive the deposit but I can spread the deposit out over 1 year making rent $2108.34/month for the first year.,counter-price
I only have one cat.. no way you can do 2100?,insist
oh I realize I didn't even ask what type of animal. I have to keep a deposit in case your cat messes up the apartment. 2101 (making it a $12 deposit spread out over the year),counter-price
"alright, fair enough",unknown
"Hey, nice looking bike. WHy are you getting rid of it?",intro
"Well, I just recently moved and I simply don't have time to ride anymore. Sure I'll put on weight and it might ruin my love life but I have a business to run and children to feed.",disagree
Hahaha,unknown
I'm asking a list price of 1800 which is a discount from the retail original price. As you can see I've added a few upgrades to the bike as well.,init-price
"Yeah, I honestly was looking at something that hadn't been ridden for a whole season. Your price is quite high for me at this point.",disagree
Well what kind of price range works for you? Let's see if we can find a price we both like.,unknown
I'm thinking about 1/2 of the asking price could work for us both,unknown
Hello,intro
Hi,unknown
I am selling these vintage pair adapters. Are you interested in buying them?,unknown
Yes I am. Are you firm on the price displayed,unknown
"These are either for sales or for trade in exchange for a old men's wind up, automatic, kenetic, solar, eco drive watch, etc..",unknown
Would you consider taking 46 dollars for the item?,init-price

You know what? You drive a hard bargain. Deal. 300 and you bring it to me.,agree
Awesome.,unknown
Hi there! I am interested in this bike but your listing already says don't be one of those idiots and send me a low ball offer. So is there room for negotiation here?,intro
"Well, there's always an opportunity to negotiate.",unknown
Great. So have you used the bike for a long time?,inquiry
"Yes, I've had it for 2 years.",inform
"Is the condition good? I mean, any scratches or scraps?",inquiry
"Well, I never rode it, it's a back up bike, so it's in good shape.",inform
Great. So would you accept $1840 for it?,init-price
"I don't know if I could accept $1840, as I said in my listing it's worth every penny and much more.",agree
So what's the last you can go?,inquiry
"If you're willing to come by and pick it up, I'd let it go for $1900.",counter-price
Sure I can do that. Its absolutely not an issue for me! I would definitely accept this offer,disagree
"Okay, great. I'll have the bike ready.",unknown
Thanks,unknown
I'm interested in your bike. Can you tell me anything about how long you've had this?,intro
"Hi. I have had this bike for about one year, and its of great quality and in an excellent condition.",unknown
I like it. I really do. But the asking price is up in the clouds. There are many of these bikes in similar condition as low as 650. You even admit in your ad that it's hard to tell what's been remade and what parts are original on this bike. I can afford something closer to the 760 dollar range.,init-price
"Well, I could give it to you for $760 provided you come and get it yourself. Does that seem fair?",counter-price
"Yeah, that absolutely sounds fair. I would be happy to come pick it up for $760. You've got a deal!",agree
"Hello, are you interested in this Cadillac?",intro
Yes. Mechanically is it sound?,inquiry
"Yes, the car is in good shape, but it needs a little work. The engine light is on, and I think it's an 02 sensor.",inform
Are you willing to negotiate on the price?,inquiry
"Well, I priced the car with the consideration that it probably will need around $1,000 dollars worth of work over the next few months, so I think $3600 is a fair price.",init-price
"In the condition it's in and then having an engine issue, that seems really high. Bluebook is showing more like $2000 but that does seem a little low to me. Maybe around $2400?",counter-price
"If you're willing to come pick the car up, I'd go down to $2600",counter-price
That seems fair. I'll go $2600,agree
"Okay, great, I look forward to seeing you.",unknown
"Hello, are you interested in this TV stand?",intro
Does it have scratches and is everything working good and solid on it?,inquiry
It's in great shape.,inform
How long is it?,inquiry
"It's made for a 55 inch tv, it's about 50 inches wide across the top",inform
Would you be willing to take $75 for it?,init-price
"Well, it's in really good shape, the problem is my wife decided that we had to change out all of the furniture in our living room after 1 year of having it, because she's evidently deranged.",unknown
Are you willing to negotiate on the price?,inquiry
"If you're willing to come and pick it up, I'd be willing to drop it down to $100.",counter-price
I could go $85.00.,counter-price
If I offer to throw in my crazy wife will it help you come up at all in price?,inquiry
No thanks. Just the TV stand at $85.00. You'd have to pay me to take her haha.,insist
"Hmm, well, I guess I don't have a choice, $85 it is.",agree
"Hello, I'm interested in the bicycle you have listed.",intro
It is in great condition. I haven't hardly ridden it which is why I am selling it.,disagree
"Well, I could take it off your hands. I'd like to pay $650.",init-price
I can come down a little but it has less than 100 miles and I just had it cleaned and tuned up so everything is truly in excellent shape. I could go $850,counter-price
"Well, it's a little girl sized bike, and i'm 6'4"". If I'm going to look ridiculous riding around on this bicycle, I at least want to save a little more money than that.",unknown
"Actually is very comfortable. I am 6'2"" and it rides and handles great.",unknown
"Well, the best I could do is $800.",counter-price
I can do that if you're picking it up today.,unknown
"Okay, great, I'll be at your house tonight.",unknown
Are you interested in the house?,intro
I am but was wondering about the location. What is that close to?,inquiry
"This home is located in a great part of town.  It is on a quiet cul de sac, but walking distance to the town center with shops and restaurants.  It is a safe walk too.  Lined with brand-new sidewalks all the way.",inform
I wish you accepted pets and had a washer/dryer. Would you be willing to go $2200?,init-price
"No, sorry, too low.  There is a washer/dryer hook up.",vague-price
I don't have a washer or dryer. The place I'm at now included it. Who takes care of the lawn/landscaping?,unknown
We have a service comes once a month for the lawn and bushes.,unknown
I could go $2500 if you can include a washer/dryer but that's the best I can do.,counter-price
"I have a couple coming to view the property today.  If you could do 2800 the property is yours, but otherwise I'll have to wait until after the viewing.",counter-price
I can do $2600 with the washer/dryer but that is a stretch.,counter-price
I have other business to tend to so I'll tell you what...I'll take 2600 but no washer dryer.,agree
$2550 and that will leave me enough to rent a washer/dryer?,counter-price
Ok... you got a good deal.,unknown
it's an oem set? was it made by blackberry or a third party?,intro
"This is the real mccoy my friend, an oem headset.",unknown
well these days they call a third party made products oems now. you can never be sure. anyway how about i give you 5 bucks for it?,init-price

"well, they all have on and off buttons now. it's not a big deal. besides we';ve had on and off buttons on things for a century. tell you what, 6 bucks. i come and pick it up. you don't even have to leave your house.",counter-price
Let this incredible headset go at only $6? I couldn't take less than 8.50!,counter-price
you know what? I think that's  fair price. let's do 8. this system doesn't do decimals,counter-price
"Sure, I guess we can do $8.",agree
done deal,unknown
Hi are you interested in my zip bike?,intro
"Hi. Yes, it's a nice bike but it's kind of old.",unknown
True but I just had it tuned up. My asking price is $400 but it's negotiable.,init-price
Are there any defects I should know about? I was thinking $200 would be a good price for it.,counter-price
"No defects, I don't think I can take $200. What if I deliver it to you, can you come up to $300?",counter-price
If you throw in some knee pads and a helmet I could come up with $240.,counter-price
"Hmm, I do have those and won't have any use for them. $250 with drop off, safety gear and an extra chain I have laying around?",counter-price
Ok. That sounds perfect. $250 will work.,agree

"Well, I'd be interested. I'd like to pay $1640.",init-price
geesh man. that's not right. that's literally half the price i'm asking i really can't let go of this car for less than 3000,counter-price
"I'd be willing to come and pick it up, but the top of the market for a 15 year old car for me is going to be $2000.",counter-price
"This is  toyota. japanese cars don't go by KBB. and this is a 6 speed manual with a rebuilt motor. this car will literally last you another 100k no problems. the lowest is 3000. if you can't do it, we can't make any deals",insist

"Ok, but I'm worried about the rust, do you know if it's gone through the frame?",inquiry
"No, it's purely cosmetic. A fresh coat of paint will fix that right up for you.",disagree
Well it's a little more work than I care to take on. I'd like to get it for $90. I'm probably going to have to take it to a restorer.,counter-price
It really won't need much work at all but I do have some wiggle room. $90 is just too low for the collector's item. I could take $160 for it.,counter-price
I'll bring my offer up to $110 but do you have a helmet I could have. Safety first and all that.,counter-price
Ok. I'll take $110 for and throw in the helmet.,agree

I can appreciate a tight budget but I can't accept that. I just shelled out money for the tune up so I'm looking for something like $950.,counter-price
"I can understand that.  It's great that you're taking care of it and maintaining its value.  If you can get it to me by Wednesday, I'd be willing to go $900.",counter-price

That's way too much for me. It's not like it's fit for a museum or anything. How about $500?,counter-price
a 37 year olf BMX bike IS fit for a museum. You're buying a part of history. not some junk bike. This is a schwinn i remind you. I really can't do lower than 900,counter-price
I really don't have that much money. You have to help me out here. I can scrape together $650 but that's it.,counter-price

"It's only 5 years old, I'm the original owner.",unknown
What kind of condition is it in? $200 seems steep for a five year old bike.,init-price
"It's in excellent condition. There's absolutely nothing wrong, paint is in tip top shape. It's never been crashed.",unknown
Nice. Would you consider taking $140 for it if I pick it up myself?,init-price
"I don't think I can go that low, I can throw in a free helmet for $180.",counter-price
That sounds fair.,unknown
Hi $375 for an almost new phone with all the extras like charghing head and cable.,init-price
"Hi. Considering the S8 just came out, would you be willing to negotiate on the price a bit?",unknown
I can consider offers. It does have 32GB storage. I'd be willing to come down to $375 and will even throw in a free micro sd card.,insist
Hmmm. I saw one in similar condition and with all the extras like you're offering for $250 but they're farther away from me. How about I meet you at $300 and you throw in the micro SD card?,counter-price

Yes!  It is still available and I'm interested in selling!  :),unknown
Can you tell me anything about it,inquiry
"I am the original owner, bought it new in 2006.  Great vehicle - has never left me stranded.  The interior is nearly pristine and the exterior looks very good (some dings like you would expect from an 11 year old vehicle).  Still drives great.  Only 85,000 miles.",inform
"Ok, how much are you asking?",inquiry
I'm asking $7800.  I bought a new Escalade and no longer need this one.,init-price
"Ok, I will offer you 4600 for it.",counter-price
"Uh, no.  Book on it is $8300.  I'm already below that.  I'd be willing to consider an offer that is more reasonable, but $4600 is over three-thousand below my asking price.",counter-price
Well to be honest I found the same care with less miles for cheaper.  If oyu are willing to throw in a warranty and deliver it for me I will offer more.,unknown
"OK, I can offer a 1 year warranty and will bring it to you, but I need you to make an offer.",unknown
Best I can go is 6900,counter-price
Make it an even $7000 and you have a deal.,counter-price
"Hey so I have a great amp for sale, it's only $45. It was much more new.",init-price
How old is the Fender amp?,inquiry
"It's only 5 years old, it's in great condition. The only thing you have to worry about is a slight bit of rust in the corners, but that should come off with some elbow grease.",inform
"Okay, would you say the amp works perfectly?",inquiry
"Yes, it's extremely loud. I can include the amplifier cord to go to the guitar as well. Does $45 sound good?",counter-price
I was actually thinking more like $30 since it's 5 years old and has some rust on the corners.,counter-price

ok that's fine and how are the tires and current chain,unknown
Both are in excellent condition. Not a scratch on the bike.,disagree
Ok well im working with a budget of 684. Now i should remind you this is still a used bike and even with your upgrades it wouldn't push it too 900 I could get a completely stock bike for 779,init-price
"I am actually taking a loss asking the $900. I am willing to negotiate on the price, however, I cannot go that low.",counter-price
Well yes selling this.  Bike without much use.  Is certainly a loss for you but i did my reasearch and your exact model and your upgrades have gone down in price when bought brand new now a brand new bike with those up grades would run me about 820 so that would certainly mean your bike value has significantly reduced. If 684 is too low I can do 699 and i will pick it up,counter-price
This bike was only used three times and it has been parked in a garage. It is very clean with many upgraded parts. I could do $790 and I will deliver it to you.,counter-price
How about 740 with meet me halfway delivery,counter-price

"Awesome! I'm pretty good with installing stereos, if I skip the installation, is there any chance I could get a lower deal on these? Somewhere around $85 - $90?",counter-price
Are you sure pretty good instal is what you want? Because I could go $95 which would give you expert instillation along with a great set of subs.,counter-price

Understood... How about if I lower it to $300 and I'll even deliver it to you myself.,init-price
"If you could go to $200, I would come and get it today with cash in hand.",counter-price

"No, you can meet me halfway at $12 and we have a deal. You'll also have to drop it off, as I live 10 miles away and don't want to drive.",counter-price

I will be willing to go as far as $13, I can understand about dropping it off if you didn't drive but not wanting to drive is a different story.  I cannot drop it off because I do not drive.

Yes I am interested in this hutch but I would like to now if you are willing to come down on the price?,vague-price

Can I offer you $750 for it?,counter-price
"I appreciate your interest but with the handcrafting, that is just too big a loss for the showroom to take.

I listed the car at 10450 but I can work with you a little bit on the price. It has very low mileage and it's very reliable. Never had any problems with it.,init-price
"awesome. I don't quite have that kind of cash, but id be willing to shell out a little extra than the 5k I initially wanted to spend. Can you meet me at 8k? I feel thats reasonable. I can even come pick the car up.",counter-price
Well it's really already a fair price considering the mileage on it but I'll work with you a little bit. How about 9k?,counter-price
I guess that can work. thanks for being somewhat reasonable!,unknown

"Oh, by all means, what's your budget? I don't think I could justify going much lower than 35",init-price
I think we can work something out. I was originally thinking 35 but since you're throwing in some extras how about 40?,counter-price
37 for being so obliging,counter-price
hey there are you looking to buy ?,intro
"yes I am, what's the current price?",inquiry

"1800 is a little out of my budget, especially since it's only a two bedroom and its no pets. I would be willing to be  around $1400. Maybe more for pets",counter-price
"lowest we can accept is 1500, with the current policies. Im sorry but this will have to be the final offer. I hope we can make this work.",counter-price

"I understand. The price is a little higher than my budget but it looks really nice. Considering the ones across the street are only $1200 per month, could you sharpen your pencil a bit on the rate? Somewhere around $1300?",counter-price
"Oh no, I'm sorry but that is way below my price range. The ones across the street are not as well built nor does it have as many benefits as I do. I would be willing to come down to $1600.",counter-price

"Hey there, you're interested in the beautiful house?",intro

Okay I can work with that. It comes with all the cables too so that works.,unknown

What condition is the phone in and does it have a clean ESN?,inquiry
It is brand new. Never used. and yes. 100% clean ESn,init-price
Well I looked up the ESN and it's actually a bad ESN. You might want to double check that. Since it's a bad ESN it's only worth like 300. Will you take 300?,counter-price
Not a chance! I'm unsure where you got your data but this is a new/unused phone. ESN is perfectly OK.,disagree

7250,insist
oh wow that is insultingly low.,unknown

What's the mileage on it?,inquiry
"That's the best part. Only 60,000",inform

Do you still have the Toyota for sale?,intro
Yes I still have it. Are you interested?,inquiry
Yes. What kind of condition is it in and does it have any mechanical problems?,inquiry
It's in really great condition. It has 106k miles but these are mostly highway miles so the engine runs like it's lower miles than that.,inform
Okay then. The price is a little high are you willing to negotiate?,inquiry
I can negotiate a little bit but that's really a pretty reasonable price already. What were you thinking?,inquiry
Are you willing to go down to 8000?,init-price
"No that is way too low, it's worth much more than that. How about 13500?",counter-price
That is too high. I don't think it's worth that much given the mileage. How about 10500,counter-price
Since the engine is in really good condition that would really be too low. 12500 is the lowest I can go.,counter-price
Okay that sounds fair.,unknown
Hello! I am very much interested in purchasing this bike. Do you have it only in blue color?,intro
"Yes, I only have to one bike and it is blue. It was recently painted so there are no defects in the paint",disagree
"Okay, what about the price? Can we negotiate the price because its too expensive for me.",unknown
I'm asking $250 because it was recently painted and has been kept in pristine condition. I'm willing to negotiate a little but I don't have much wiggle room.,init-price
$250 is a huge amount which I at this point cannot afford nor does it fit my budget.,counter-price
What about $235? You also have to remember you're getting the headset in addition to such a great bike.,counter-price
I can give $125. You can remove the headset if it even matters?,counter-price
That barely covers the paint job. How about $250 and I throw in a helmet and knee pads that I won't be using.,counter-price
I cannot go beyond $150.,counter-price
"I'm sorry about the last offer. I meant to say $200. But that's the lowest I can go. If that won't work for you, I'll have to move on to other interested parties.",counter-price

"That is actually an issue for me, my son is ashmatic and i am sensitive to the smells . Can you come down to 2400 to make this place worth while for us?",counter-price
"I'm sorry but that's not a problem, as nobody smokes in the house currently or in the past, so as long as you don't smoke it won't be a problem for your son. I was just letting you know that you are allowed to smoke if you please. The price I can drop down to is going to have to be 2900 at the bare minimum. I hope you understand, I have other clients coming in looking at the place and some have already tried to buy it for around $2600.",counter-price
Hi! are you interested in the bike?,intro

well how com e it's so expensive? i've never seen a bike for over 1000,init-price
"Sure! At this point, it's really priced to a specialist who can appreciate the rarity of a model in this good of condition. The bike itself is a joy to ride and the fact that you won't have to do any repairs is a bonus.",disagree
alright. would you consider 800 bucks?,counter-price
Hmm...I can do $900 if you can come pick it up?,counter-price
I can most definitely come and pick it up,unknown
And $900 is acceptable?,insist

indeed i see that you did all these great things to it. it seems to be in good condition. i am willing to pay 6000,init-price
"6000 seems a little low, I was originally asking 8k but after I had to have the brakes and rotors replace along with the other maintenance I had to raise the price.",counter-price
the car is a bit old and it has very high mileage. I see that it has been taking care of however. Look my best offer is 7000k.,unknown
"Age is not as big a factor as care taken. Miles were put on consistently over the years, oil changed every 3,000 by myself with premium grade oil and filter from the dealer. Lowest I could walk away with is 8200. There aren't too many other vehicles out there in this condition that low.",counter-price
I am afraid that we can't deal then.,disagree

I could! Happy to do so.  BTW - Hookups just mean there are places to hook up your washer and dryer as they aren't included! Glad we could come to an agreement,disagree

"Well, you know what they say, being rich enough to rent out a house in California means you get to be cruel, it's just a perk of being rich.  Now, I suppose I could come down to $3,000 a month, that's only $39,000 a year to live in this wonderful neighborhood.",counter-price

That price is ridiculous. I can go to 3400 serious offers only please,unknown
"You are only dropping it $50, that's not helping me out at all. $2400, but that's all I can do.",counter-price

So both water and electricity are included in the rent?  How about garbage?  And is there a separate fee for using the swimming pool?,inquiry

You know how hard those are to find here.  The deposit is 1,500 firm, but I do have a little bit of wiggle room on the price.  Around what price are you looking for?",unknown
"My budget is around $2600 a month, would that work for you?",init-price
"How about we meet in the middle.  How does 2,775 sound?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",counter-price

How about we meet halfway. How's $75,counter-price
I can't meet you halfway since you started so low. That wouldn't be fair at all. I actually already lowered the price to 100 in the first place. So how about 90 and we have a deal.,counter-price

I hope you can forgive me for all the barter, here, because this request in no way is an insult...it's simply that I'm forced to dip into reserves here...  I might be able to scrape up enough to counter with $425...  Again, I wish I could go higher...",counter-price

"No, it is in great condition. It'd a solid bike and I am selling it at a solid price.",disagree
$80 seems just a bit high to me for this.,init-price
How much would you like to spend on this bike?,inquiry

"Hi, I'm interested in this house.",intro
"Hi, awesome to hear.  Its appraised at 120,000 but I'm hoping for a quick  sale",unknown
"Actually, the ad says it's for rent. Do you really need to sell? I am looking to rent and I need a place right away.",unknown
"Renting is available too, however I would love to sell it eventually.  after you get moved in perhaps you like to talk about leasing it to own.",unknown
"Sure, I would. What appliances are included? How many bedrooms and baths?",inquiry
"3 bedrooms, 1 bath, just blocks from the zoo and park",inform
"I like it, but I don't want to pay that much. I know you own the houses on either side. I would take over all landscaping and lawn care if you would drop the rent. to $1500.",init-price
"all apliances included.  renters are expected to clean and maintain the landscapping.  however I do have a few other properties that need some work.  I'm down for 1500 a month, if our willing to put in 40 hours labor a month.",agree
That sounds very fair to me.,unknown
"awesome.  see you soon, i'll draw up the papperwork",unknown
"Hi, I like the look and idea of this.tell me more please",intro
"This thing is great, it uses RFID technology to track so you'll never lose your keys again.",unknown
oh my ADD self needs this for sure...could you take 15 and help an old man out?,init-price
"I wish I could but they cost quite a bit to make, the quality is very high. How about $18?",counter-price
"hmm...well I really need it, so I think $18 will work for me too.",agree
Okay sounds great!,unknown
"Hi so I'm interested in buying the bedroom set, are there any scratches?",intro
"No scratches, it's in very good condition",disagree
"Great, how much can you reasonably come down to?",vague-price
Well the item is listed for $350 how much are you looking to spend,init-price
"Well a new bedroom set like this I could probably buy from the store for $500, so I'd have to say since it's used it needs to be in the 150 price range.",counter-price
"Last time I was in the store, a whole bedroom set which included the bed, dresser and two night stands was on sale for $1500 brand new.  I can go as low as 275.00",counter-price
"I still can't do that, look if you deliver it I can literally go down to $240 no lower.",counter-price
I can do $240 as long as you're in a 15-mile radius.,agree
I can be there in an hour.,unknown

Good evening!,intro
"Hey there I'd love to buy your Iphone 5s 16gb space gray, is it in good condition, not used, and will work well?",unknown

"Alright, sounds good. Can you do $150? that seems like a fair price.",init-price
"$150 is fine, thank you!",agree
"Hi, I'm interested in your bike. It's a little larger than I'm looking for, but I like the style. Would you consider accepting $150?",init-price
"Hello, do you have any questions about the Bike?",unknown
Will you sell this for $150?,insist
"No, I am willing to negotiate but that is too low. Do you have any questions about the bike? It is really in good condition.",vague-price
"I think the price is a little high, I can buy a 21-speed new for $350, and that includes a warranty. What about $165?",counter-price
"You haven't even asked any questions about the bike. If you had you would know that it has CST 700X38C hybrid tires, Schraeder valves, Rear Shimano Altus derailleur with MegaPulleys... and many other great feaures. So, as you can see this bike has many great upgrades making it fully worth the asking price of $200..",counter-price
"I'm familiar with this model of bike, my brother had one just like it. You didn't mention those upgrades in your listing though, that does add a little value to it. I'm still not sure that it's worth quite $200 though considering what I can buy new for a similar price. I'd be willing to raise my offer to $150.",counter-price
That is why I kept asking if you had any questions. I'm a bit concerned you're just a reseller looking to undercut other buyers and then make a profit. If you want a new bike without all these great upgrades you should definitely get one. But all things considered I think I'd better not accept such low offers right now. I can go $195.,counter-price

East Davis is a very popular right now and this price is pretty consistent with other similar units in the area. There are two bedrooms and two baths so there is plenty of space for two roommates!,unknown
What's in the area?,inquiry
"Plenty of cafes, restaurants, and shopping all within 5 blocks! It's a very hot area right now.",inform
How does $1200 a month sound?,init-price

"well, I can't do that low. if you 2 year leazse, I could to 3800. that's the lowest i can do",counter-price

Sine I don't know that I will be able to lower the price for you if that helps.,disagree
Yes it would...can you tell me what btu it pushes?,inquiry

So, like I said it's $400, but you are cute, so I'll give you a discount. I'm Turkish and so I will give you what we call the ""proper"" handshake. That's $20 off. Because it comes out of the ATM like that.",counter-price

I would love to buy the lamp but the most I would be willing to budge would be $140.,counter-price
Hmmm that is quite a low offer. It is only a week old and you'd be paying a lot more than that to buy it new.,unknown
"Yes, but the item is simply not new and has faced depreciation.",disagree

But I'll tell you what, if you can make the $200 I will throw in a Serge Mouille sconce, not reproduction but original Serge Mouille, it matches his lamp perfectly of course, I'll throw that in for the full $200 if you can pick them up right away.",counter-price

I'm going to hold firm on the $200 since you're not being at all reasonable and made such a lowball offer.,counter-price

"what about utilites? are they included? $2075 is a bit outside of the price range, so im trying to find a way to make this work for us because the property looks stunning!",init-price
The utilities are not included but we are a very energy efficient complex so the price on those should be very reasonable,disagree
"well, no utilities and no appliances is going to make this a lot harder than i thought. im just in love with the property. if i could move her in at the first of the month, would you take $1037?",init-price
"I am very willing to negotiate. However, that is half the asking price and would be unfair to the other renters. I would go 1900.00. there is also a microwave in most if that helps any and we would love to have your mom here.",unknown
could you offer any benefits to us at 1900? something to make this a little easier?,counter-price

150k miles. No history of accidents. It's a great little affordable car. I am selling for $3500,init-price
Wow 150k miles is a lot for a jaguar. Does it have any dings or scratches?,inquiry

I'd be willing to meet around the middle at 2500,counter-price
That sounds fair to me. Deal!,unknown
"Wow, this all looks really nice!",intro

"Thats great, but I do not need any more. How about 500 for whats listed?",counter-price
I think at this point if I would go any lower it would most likely be 800.00 which is a steal in all honesty.,counter-price
That is still a lot. I think we cannot agree. It's been a pleasure though.,disagree
I agree. You have a nice day!,unknown

"well, without utilities and no fridge... the benefits are shrinking. i really want to move in here. would you be able to do $947?",init-price

"yes, but most places have at least all needed appliances or include utilities. ill admit the laundry service, pool, and gym are attractive benefits though. how about $1500 to move in-- i could sign the lease this afternoon.",counter-price
Make it 1550 and we have a deal!,counter-price

Its lited at 350. I an  go to 320,counter-price
Hrm I am a little tight on cash right now. What about 250?,counter-price
280 and its a deal!,counter-price
The phone is unlocked which means if it breaks I am responsible for paying for that or just a new phone. I think cosmetic is going to bother me a little so I will need to buy a new case. And again I am super tight on money and could use a break what do you say 250?,insist

I appreciate you being willing to pick it up. Can you swing 2700?,counter-price
I wish i could. I see similar products on the market for 2500 brand new. 2100 seems like a fair price no?,counter-price
I've put a lot of money and time into making it exactly like this. I'd like to at least break even. It was actually more than 2500 brand new and I've put 1000 into it with the custom parts. So 2100 I'd be loosing a lot.,counter-price

If i sighed a year lease and paid for all the rent up front what would you be willing to do?,inquiry
"Well, annual rent at the list price of 2250 would come out to 27000, but if you would be willing to sign the years lease, I could bring it down to about 25200. It may seem like its not significantly less, but with almost all of the utilities included, the savings would definitely be meaningful, given that there are so few bills left to pay.",init-price

"While I dont mind the accomodation of pets (heck, I actually love them!), there would need to be an additional deposit for housing the pets, just in case something did happen.

"That sounds perfect, works out to $2075 a month so that's what I am offering but I will be paying it all up front plus the pet deposit.",counter-price
Sounds good to me. I hope you enjoy the place!,unknown

I am afraid $160 is rather low for the condition it is in. It works perfectly! The cc swiper has never even been used.,agree
"I understand that. But it is used, not brand new. So there are still some risks to buying it for me. I can go up to 180, but that is as high as I will go.",counter-price

"Unfortunately that's much too low for a car that's worth 20, even with the expiring warranty. I could go down as far as 18500, but that's as far as I can go.",counter-price
"Well, it's worth 20 on the blue book. But at 53k miles, it's been driven about 13k miles a year. That's a bit high. I bet it's due for a fair amount of work so that warranty would be handy. I guess I could do 14500.",counter-price
"I can't do 14500. I guess I can do 18, but that's my final offer.",counter-price
I'd be able to do something like that if you'd be willing to pay for a mechanic to inspect it,unknown

"Nah, nothing liek that, but once you see it, you can tell it's a genuine item it's dense, all wool, beautiful patterns. you'll love it",inform
with no certificate of authenticity I am afraid i could only offer 150. Do you have any other perks you could throw in to justify a higher price?,init-price
"Well the problem is that certificates are not always issued with the persian rugs. This was bought in Iran and i personally brought it over. so, the lowest i can do really is 250",counter-price

Would you take $600 cash for the set? I can also pick it up. No delivery necessary.,init-price
"Thats a little low. Could we do $800? I really wanted $1,000 for the set.",counter-price

"We can jump in and I was hoping to get a deal for around 2500, I know this is lower than you expect but I can offer my services as a landscaper or interior maintenance if you need any help like that?",init-price
"$2500 is a fair price. We can definitely get you set up here for that much. We can figure out lease length later on, I'm sure you'll absolutely love the place!",agree

I was thinking I could do $120,init-price

"Oh you don't have a truck?  I do so how about this, for 850 you load it in my truck I can drive it to your house and you unload it there.  I just can't move or deliver by myself as I am 8 months pregnant so no lifting.",counter-price
"Hi, can you tell me a little bit more about this bike?",intro
yeah sure. i've had it for a year. I replaced some parts on it. it's still in a great condition,unknown
"Given that it's steal, which is very heavy, and that the brakes squeak, which means they're not in good shape and need to be tuned up, can you come down to $60? I'd be willing to come get it and buy it without a road test, even though there's no picture",init-price
"it's pretty light given it's made of sturdy steel. and brake squeaking can be fixed with new pads. no biggy, i can do that for you. but 60 is too low, i can't let it go for anythign below, say, 120?",counter-price

I think you're looking at the wrong bike then.  This is an upgraded Jamis.  Are you not willing to pay the $165?  I'm not even going to consider $50.,insist
"Well that's a shame considering that's about what you're looking at for a used low-end bike, which is effectively worth nothing to you if it's not sold at all. The question here is whether or not $165 is worth waiting forever for, or whether you'll accept 75 and get on with your life.",counter-price

It has 230000 miles. It is a bit old but it has a clean title and passed the smog recently. Also no scratches or dents!,disagree
Sounds roughly par for the course. What's shaken loose after all those miles? Have there been any major repairs?,inquiry
The only thing wrong with it is a cracked windshield. Other than that tires are great and it runs amazing,inform
"So, being a 2001 model -- what can you tell me about its car seat compatibility?",inquiry
It has all the belt attachments on the back for car seats. We used it with all my kids and never had problems,inform
"Now. It does sound like it's a solid hunk of metal -- but the age of the thing does give me pause when I consider I'm going to be putting my kids into it. It's not failed yet, but I can't help but wonder when the other shoe will drop.",disagree
The older the better! Now days all new cars are made with cheap metal that gets destroyed easily in if you crash. How about we settle for 2800?,init-price
"Okay, good point. 2500 and we've got a deal.",counter-price
"Hello, how are you?",intro
"Great, thanks!  Are you interested in the el Camino?  It's a great car!",unknown
"Yes, I am. I would love to add it to my collection I have at home.",unknown
"You won't regret it! This car has everything you could ask for and only 8k miles on the new motor.  The asking price is $17000, but I'm willing to negotiate the price or trade for a nice fishing boat of equal value.",init-price
It looks great! I have a jet ski and some cash.,unknown
"Jet skis are great, but not what I'm looking for.  How much are you willing to pay for the car?  I'd love to make a deal with you.",disagree
I can do 15500 for the car,counter-price
That will work for me!,unknown
Awesome. Thank you.,unknown
"Hello, how are you?",intro
"I am well Thanks, How about yourself?",inquiry
I am good. I saw your ad and I would love to live there! What is the crime rate like?,inquiry
The area is phenomenal. I have not heard of many problems at all in the neighborhood.,disagree
That is great new.! I see all of the nice amenities that come with it! But 2095 is a bit much for me right now. Could we talk a lower price?,init-price
It really is a great price for this place. I could do $2000 flat for you though. There is so much included already. The view is spectacular. An amazing inground pool. Gas is included. You get your very own private balcony.,init-price
2000 would be great. I know this is well worth my money. I appreciate it!,agree
"Great, I am looking forward to meeting you.",unknown

"Yes. It is absolutely beautiful and would look great in my office. I see there is trim missing, correct? Anything else?",inquiry
It's in good condition aside from the missing trim.  That's why I have it priced so low.  If that trim can be repaired it will likely bring the value up.,inform
"Okay, Could you let it go for $20 and I can pick it up in the morning on my way out of town?",counter-price
That would be great.  We have a deal!,unknown
Thank you so much. I will also pay you in cash. I appreciate your time. Have a nice day.,unknown

Great.  Is there any wiggle room on the price?  Any chance I could do $1700/month for the first 6 months and then up to the full price of $2025 for the last 6 months?  That would give me time to find a rooomate.,counter-price
1800 and we'll have a deal. I could give you a month to pay if you pay the deposit up front.,counter-price
