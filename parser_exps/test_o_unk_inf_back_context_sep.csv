It is garage kept ever since I have owned it. It is top of the line. All new parts and rarely riden. I would not accept 100.00 I would work on my asking price of 1200.00 though. I was asking if you would take 1100 not 100. Sorry I should have been more specific. Sounds liek a great bike, why are you selling it? I am just getting to old to ride, and I have no children. I want someone else to enjoy it. I would accept 1100 for the bike, I want someone to own it who wil use it and have fun with it. That sounds good to me and I thank you being so reasonable about it.","Hi I am interested in your bike. Great, do you have any questions? I was wondering if you are willing to take 100 less for it?

"That's a very sweet bike! Yes, it has brought me a lot of good times. I'm asking $1700 for it. Why are you parting with it? I am taking a new job and moving. Won't have time to ride it. Ah, quite a shame. It looks a bit worn so I think $1700 is way overpriced. No way. It is only four years old. What are you willing to pay for it?","That's a very sweet bike!

Is there any way I can have it at that price if I take it today and pay you cash? I'd be willing to sell the room for $1470 if you can come right now. That sounds great. I can do that.

Based on the size of the apartment, I think that rice is very unreasonable. I recently saw a similar apartment for $900. The max I can pay for this aparment in $1000. The amenities in this apartment are top notch, it was recently remodeled and has been well taken care of. Tell you what, I can do $1350, and I will throw in free monthly parking which is usually $50 a month. If you can do it for 1250, we have a deal. I can do that, we have a deal","Hello hello, how are you doing tonight? HI, how are you.

"I have an interest in this apartment. Thats great to hear, would you like to come in for a little preview or have you seen everything you need to? I need to move in right away, as my current lease is running out. I would love to make a deal today. Okay sounds great! Would you be willing to pay the listed price of $979? I would love to negotiate a lower price, as the other apartment that I am looking at is priced at 700. This one looks much better though. Could you take a lower price? This is a rather premium apartment, how about i waive the safety deposit for a month and move to 750? . That sounds fantastic!","I have an interest in this apartment.

That is a little pricey but I appreciate that you went through the conversion process. It is a beauty! The picture does not do it justice. . <sep> Great! Thank you!

"Hey there heard you were looking for a mountain bike? Yeah I'm super excited to finally get one, can you tell me about yours? It's in great quality, though it's quite old and I'm not sure of the specs. Well in that case I can't really offer that much for it. That's fine, anything around 100-150 dollars would work","Hey there heard you were looking for a mountain bike? Yeah I'm super excited to finally get one, can you tell me about yours?

Hello. Hey I'm pretty interested in the lamp looks really good,Hello. <sep> Hey I'm pretty interested in the lamp looks really good
"Hello. Hey I'm pretty interested in the lamp looks really good. Thank you for your interest. Any questions I can answer for you? How long have you had it and are there any damages or scratches also is the shade very secure on the lamp? It's in almost perfect condition. Had it for a few months, but it just doesn't fit anywhere in my space. Fits perfectly together though. Makes it unique. I see did you purchase it new? Yes, got it new. It's a danish modern style with a vintage feel. Really awesome and unique. I see interesting tell you what i can give you $96 cash tomorrow for the lamp and i can pick it up. 96 is a bit below what I'm comfortable with accepting. Tell you what. 120 and I'll throw in this very cool light bulb I found for it. Ah no need for a light bulb I intend to use a dynamic color changing Phillips led in it. Gonna go great for setting up an intimate mood with my special someone. Well that's ok but I still can't go under 120. It's already a 40 dollar drop so I think it's very fair. Ok then how about 99? I go down 40 but you come up by 3? Doesn't seem too reasonable though. Well it is a used lamp also I'm working with a budget plus come on it doesn't look like it's worth that much money how about 105. Well I believe it's worth 160 so asking you for 120 is already a good deal. My absolute lowest is 115 and that's really just take it or leave it. I can't give it away. .

"I'm very interested in the pointer. I'll give you 18 for it, and I'll come and pick it up. Great. I'm afraid I need a little more for it than that. How about 30? That's still pretty high. IT's just a pointer and used one at that. I'll tell you what. I'll give you 25 if it has new batteries. Well it's a little more than that. It controls your presentation device and is compatible with PC or Mac. I could go as low as 30 if you have cash. WEel, all the pointers do that nowadays. I do have cash, and I'll give 27. I think 30 is my bottom dollar. It's brand new and factory sealed. ok. fine 30 it is then.","I'm very interested in the pointer. I'll give you 18 for it, and I'll come and pick it up. Great.

"Good evening, are you interested in this really nice glass office desk? Yes, very interested. How long have you owned this chair? There is no chair, just the glass desk and a set of drawers.  I have owned it for about one year. Sorry was confused by the picture. Have you used this desk alot? It was used a little, I bought it thinking I would be able to do some work at home, but then we had our third child, and we need to make the home office a playroom.  Otherwise, I would be keeping this desk.  I loved it.  If you can pick up the desk, I wold be willing to sell it for $65. Would you be able to go down to $55 to compensate the gas I would use coming to pick it up? I will be willing to meet you half way between my last offer and your offer, $60.  The desk cost me quite a bit more than that. That sounds like a fair deal to me.","Good evening, are you interested in this really nice glass office desk? Yes, very interested.

"Hey, I'm interested in this item but I'm on a budget. Is your list price your final offer? This bike is a great deal as you can see from the description.

I feel as though $800 is a reasonable asking price considering the high end components. The frame looks great, but I'm concerned about maintenance costs and more fragile components.

Hi I'm interested in the bike. excellent it is in excellent condition. Do you have additional information about it? 24 pounds. shimano deore xt crankset. egg beater pedals disc brakes. rock shoc racing forkds. ritcher comp handlebars and stem. indeed this bike is state of the art. I would give you 500 for it in cash. I'll pick it up and get it out of your hair. 800 I'm afraid. i am very fond of this bike and i am not eager to just give it too anyone. I'm afraid that's a bit too much for what you are asking for. I think 560 would work well. I am not eager to see it go for 560. This is a great MTB. But i will part with it if you are willing to get to 680 but that is the absolute lowest. I think 640 would be the highest I could go. hahaha. let us meet in the middle to 660?

"Hello, I seen your rug posted and I am very intrested in it. Are there any noticeable signs of wear? Not too bad. It is a bit furled at the edges. I see. Well generally 500 is kind of a premium price on rugs of this style. Do you have any room on the price? A little bit. What are you willing to offer? I would be willing to offer 350 for the rug, cash in hand. Hmm. It is definitely worth more than that considering it is vintage and has rare pink and earth tones. I could do 450. Well, lets just skip all the back and forth and say we meet in the middle at 400 cash today, and we both feel we did okay in the deal. That actually sounds good.

Well, my wife isn't currently working because we just had a child, so our budget is a bit reduced.  However, we'd still like to buy a home to have a little extra space for our expanded family.  I was hoping I could get something for around $1500. That sounds fair. How about 1800? Does that sound fair to you? I mean, it's a little over my budget, but with the fenced backyard and the easy commute to work, I think that's a good price.

"Hi, I am interested in the car you have for sale, can you tell me a bit about it please? It's a great care, good gas mileage, and everything's in working order. I'm starting at $3500. I see the ad says something about 'smogged' ... I have never heard that before... can you tell me what that means? It means the car's emissions were checked to see if they were up to EPA standards, and they are. Ok, excellent. Glad to hear it. $3500 is still a bit out of my price range though... Any other used car you find in this price range is going to be a complete rust bucket. This car is fully functional, and the AC even still works. I know with all the increased flooding all over the US due to climate change there are a lot of very damaged cars being sold right now. Could you provide a carfax report to make sure no damage has been reported on this car?","Hi, I am interested in the car you have for sale, can you tell me a bit about it please?

Okay, well i am interested but 4000 is too expensive for my budget, especially when there is only 1 bath. Ideally, I would like to pay 2800 for it. There are a lot of additional amenities and I'd be willing to drop the price, but I'm unable to go that low. Would you be interested at 3500? I can go to 3200. That's the most my budget would allow. I can do 3200 if you accept it unfurnished. Does that sound good to you? <sep> Great, I have my own furnishing so works out perfect. Thanks!"

The appliances are not included, but all utilities are included in rent. hmmm...that's an expense I was not counting on.  What do you call a fair price? $4000 Is the asking price, I can assure you it is worth well over that. I think 4000 is a little high for a house with no appliances.  I was looking more at 2200. The work we have put into the house is worth alot more than the asking price as is... I suppose I could agree to have appliances installed for you if you are willing to give me at least $3500. Now you're talking.  I think we have a deal! Great! I'll be happy to see you in your new home!","hi, is the house still available? It sure is. Were you looking to buy it?

"Hi are you still selling the trike? Yes the trike is still here. Are there any problems with it what condition is it in? It's in excellent condition, very well kept. No problems at all. Sounds good. Can you work with me on the price? Sure I can work with you on the price a little bit. Okay my budget is around $600 how does that sound? 600 is way too low, look how much the trike has, custom sound, alpine speakers, JVC amp, the excellent condition, etc. Okay in that case would you do 950. I will go down to 1150 if you come and pick it up. I'll even throw in the spare tires which I could use for something else. That sounds fair we have a deal.","Hi are you still selling the trike?

"So you're interested in the iPhone? Yes, I'm not sure is this the latest model. Just checking. I've got a few other items for sale. It's not the latest but I kept it in pristine condition. Since it is not new, I would like to offer you half of the list price. New sim card. Original everything. Always had a screen protector. I'm asking $160 which is a pretty good discount from what you'd pay at the Apple store. I think $100.00 is more reasonable since it is like new condition. It is a phone and there are no other perks available. They're selling for $210 on Amazon without the Sim Card. I'll take $150 to get a deal done now, but otherwise I'm not in a hurry to sell. What do you think? This Apple iPhone is not new. There is no case offered and I need a warranty or assurance that it will continue to work. My offer is $120.00. I think this is a very reasonable deal. I think we're just too far apart on what we're looking for. Hopefully you find the deal you're looking for somewhere else!

"I would like to buy your volvo xc90. the price is 4500.  It is a good car with no issues. 4500 is a bit steep for a 2004 model, I would be more interested at a price point near $2000. Sorry I can't go that low.  I would consider coming down to $4000 but no lower. 135K miles is a lot, even with a new transmission there are probably parts going bad that I will have to deal with $2500 and I will pick it up and take care of the title transfer. I simply cannot go that low sorry. If you have records of all service performed on the car I could meet you at $3500 but that is my absolute max. ok I guess Icould do that if you pick it up and handle the title transfer.","I would like to buy your volvo xc90. the price is 4500.

It also comes with a washer/dryer/dishwasher/stove and oven, and has a large patio and backyard. The yard is also mowed and maintained by my associate, so you never have to worry about doing yard work. Ooh, I like the sound of that.  Yard work is a pain.  How about $2000, and I'll sign a 2 year lease.  Anything more than that is really out of my price range. That is a little low, I have many people that are interested in the rental. But if you are willing to sign a 2 year lease, I can do $3200 per month. I'm neat, don't throw wild parties, non-smoker, and no pets.  I might be able to swing 2300, but that's as high as I can go. You sound like you would make a great tenant. I can meet you in the middle at $2800, but I honestly can't go any higher. Can you do $2600?  As it is, I'm going to be eating ramen for a while. I can $2600 on a 2 year lease, as long as you agree not to have any pets and keep the rental in excellent condition. Deal!  Make it a 3 three lease-- I plan on staying in the area for a while. <sep> Sounds good!"
"I am interested in your car.  What is the best offer you have received? I had an offer of 17000, that's a bit too low for me, as I need to pay my debt off. Thats too high for me. I can offer 14000 today cash. I can't go that low, how about 16000? I can do 15000 and throw in a free fridge that is like new that I was going to sell. Sounds good!","I am interested in your car.

It wasn't that serious, and I went to a highly rated body shop to get it fixed. The car is in great shape overall. That's good.  It looks like it's in good shape from the picture you posted.  Seeing as it's 10 years old, would you be willing to take $3000 for it? I can do $3,600. Ok, that sounds fair.","Good afternoon. Are you interested in the Prius I have for sale?

"Hello I am interested in your listing. Hello, great!  we are running a special with 200.00 off.  would you like to put in an application. Would that be $200 off for just the first year and then the rate would go up by $200 or more the next year? No, the 200 would stay for the length of your lease and then would go up or stay the same based upon rental rates once you re up your lease.  we are also offering 1/2 off security deposit at this time. Hmm ok. I notice it says ""Hardwood-style"" flooring, that means it is laminate right? Yes that is correct. Are there any amenities like a swimming pool or clubhouse? we do offer swimming privileges with rent. Ok that all sounds really good. But for those amenities and the location, I'm told the rent really should be closer to the $2000 range so I'm wondering what I'm missing that is making the rate so high even with the small $200 discount... The rent in this location is comparable to other apartments in this neighborhood.  We offer all applkiances already built into the home as well as granite countertops, walk in closets, oversized soaking tubs and a spacious area to live with `19ft lofts.  We would be willing to accept 2800.00 for the rent price. Well considering there are swimming privileges I think I could afford to go as high as $2750.

"Hello!   Do you have any questions about the Prius? How many miles does it have on it? You say ""had backup camera"" does it work? There are 180,000 miles on the car, mainly highway.

You say ""had backup camera"" does it work? I need something reliable. It does have a lot of miles on it. Mostly highway though. Would you accept 2100? It is a very reliable car.

Or, if it helps, I can take the $2,250 as a deposit and hold for you for a month so you can come up with the rest of the money. That's too steep for me at this time. I still would have to make sure it is roadworthy. That's really nice of you but I will need that month to get it ready for her to take to college.","Hello!

"Hello. Hi! I'm interested in the nightstand. I would offer $50, and I can pick it up! I really can't go below $65. Hmmm. Could you deliver it? For delivery it'll have to be $70. That's pretty high. Are you sure you can't come down? I don't want to pay more than $60. Lowest I can do is $65, and I can throw in a top cover, which works well if you plan on putting a lamp on top. That sounds pretty good.","Hello. Hi! I'm interested in the nightstand. I would offer $50, and I can pick it up! I really can't go below $65. Hmmm. Could you deliver it?

"Hey, can I help you? I'm wondering if there is anything wrong with this? I clipped a deer with it a few months ago, but paid to have it repaired and it's been 5 by 5 since then. Nice. Does it have a lot of miles? 180,000 miles, mostly highway, but that's because it gets such good highway mileage at 40 miles per gallon. Back-up camera doesn't work, though. Okay. Would you be willing to take $2200? I'm thinking that's too low. I'd be willing to go $3,400 and I'll fix the back-up camera. If you fix that then I will pay that.","Hey, can I help you?

Ok, you ay the seats are coming apart, do you mean the vinyl is ripped, or are they coming off of the frame? The vinyl is just ripped up. Ok, are the chains in good shape, frames bent? They are in great condition as far as the frames and chains go.  New tubes and seats and they will have plenty of life left in them. Cool, is the 25 per bike or is that for both? That is actually for each bike but if you take both I can do $40. Oh, I was hoping the $25 was for both I thought it was about $12 per bike.

"Hello, I'm interested in your Civic, can you tell me more about it? Good little car, great gas mileage. Only 60k original miles. I used it to commute to back and forth to work. No issues that I can think of, just a nice little car that is cheap to drive. What kind of gas mileage does it get? I am averaging around 30 city/ 37 highway. That's good, but I'm not so sure I want to pay so much for such an old car. How about $4600? I couldn't come down nearly that low. Car is in great shape, and only 60k miles. This car is good for at least another 140k miles, perhaps more with really good care. I could come down to $6000 if that helps you. I suppose I could stretch that much in a month or two, but right now the most I can do is $5500. Cash in hand, you pick up today, I will go to $5500. Sounds good.

It is in a premium area and is only a 7 minute walk to the BART station so you can get anywhere! I can tell by the photo that the apartment is in good shape, however I think that 1500 for that area is a little steep.   Would you be willing to negotiate the price with me? I can go a little lower does 1250 suit you a little better? I can tell that you have kept the apartment in pristine shape and really seem to care about it.   I am an excellent tenant and will treat the property as if it were my own.  My budget only allows for 1050, but I can also mow the lawn and do the outdoor upkeep if you are willing. Yes that will work perfectly now i wont have to arrange for upkeep of the lawn!","Hi how are you? Good thank you.

"Checking out the awesome bike, huh? Do you have any questions? Yes, are you including the big bike with the trailer thing or is it separate? It's for the trailer part. It attaches to your own bike (collar included) to help teach your kids how to shift. It looks pretty cool but I see that it has a bit of wear. How would you feel about accepting $50 for it? Well, that's proof that it's done its job! We could do $75, I could throw in a good scrubdown, the Warriors flag, and even deliver it for you. :-). $75 sounds good and if you have a kiddie helmet to keep my kid's noggin safe that would be good. Sure do, and it even has a mohawk on it!","Checking out the awesome bike, huh? Do you have any questions? Yes, are you including the big bike with the trailer thing or is it separate?

"That BMW sure looks interesting.  I'm looking to buy for around $3000. Im not really in a rush to sell it so I expect more than that for it. It has excellent interior conditions. I like nice interiors for going parking with robots.  I see it's got a lot of miles on it, though. How about $3200? Yeah it has a lot of miles but its on great running conditions, how abou 3600.","That BMW sure looks interesting.  I'm looking to buy for around $3000.

Are there any kid friendly areas, such as parks, in the area? The schools are great. The elementary school is 3 blocks away. A few playgrounds and there is common area outside the unit. Great! Do you accept pets? We accept cats and small dogs. Awesome! What is the going monthly rate? The rent is 1900 a month. It's a steal for the area especially you get your own parking. That is a bit out of our range, considering we would have to purchase new furniture.","Hi! I am very interested in this aparnment. Is it still available? It is! It's a great place.

"Hi. Are you interested in this bike I am selling? I am interested. What are you looking for? I was hoping to get 60 dollars for it. It is in good condition and the tires are almost brand new. I understand that. However, I do see that I'll need to replace the chain and put air in the tires, so that's a bit of a disadvantage to me. How about $50? 50 dollars might work. I can only accept cash payments though, Is that alright with you? That's fine with me. I'll agree to 50 in cash only. That will be fine. Let's do it.","Hi.

". I lost my ear plugs from my iphone and would love a new pair.  I saw your ad but 5 dollars is a bit steep.  Would you consider 2 dollars? Considering that it is new and I am handling the shipping I would think $5 is a very good price. How much is the shipping? I can ship USPS for a couple of dollars. If you pay the shipping, I will go to 3.50 tops.  I understand they are new but I will be getting a new iphone soon and it will come with a pair. Your offer is tempting and I can come down to 4.00 including shipping. If you are willing to take 3.75 we will have a deal. We can do it for that. Thank you",".

"hello. Hello. I am looking for a new vehicle and read over your listing. Can you give me an estimate on what gas mileage to expect? Well thanks for checking out the listing! Gas mileage is great and you wont have to worry about refueling on your trips out of state. its around 29 on highways. That sounds great. I travel for work so that is very important. Are the tires new or will I need to replace them shortly if I purchase  the car? its a 2016. The tires are spectacular! Its only got 8k miles on engine, so there is a ton of tread left for you to coast through the sunset with. You're also getting keyless entry in this model as well as ALL leather interior. It doesn't get better than that. Would you consider taking $19000 for the car so some funds are left over for taxes and registration? How bout we settle for 20,000 BUT,  Ill add a bluetooth adaptor and mood lighting in the vehicle Before i hand you the keys. Okay. Deal. Thank you.","hello. Hello.

"Hi! Do you offer two-month leases? 2 month lease allowed, but the listeing price is for a one year.  I would do a 2 lease for 4000/mo. You must think me a fool or a rich man. There are zero details about the other rooms and all I can see is the kitchen. $2500/mo and I'll stay the year. I'm sorry, but that won't even cover the propery taxes levied by the governments of Pleasenton, CA. Seems like a problem a property owner deals with. Cover my maid and laundry service and I'll go up to $3000. Sorry, but that's a serious lose situation for me.  the nature of pricing is that costs are always flowed to the consumer.  I'll be able to fill this resort-style ameneitie home with rolling lawns and parks, and boutique shops, with a renter if you find yourself unable to come to terms with the cost of living... also, the sooner we come to an agreement, the more of these HITS we can do per hour.  3500/mo final price. $3250, since you're in a rush. . whatever.","Hi!

I'll be able to fill this resort-style ameneitie home with rolling lawns and parks, and boutique shops, with a renter if you find yourself unable to come to terms with the cost of living... also, the sooner we come to an agreement, the more of these HITS we can do per hour.  3500/mo final price. $3250, since you're in a rush. . <sep> whatever."
"Hello, I'm interested in your 3D glasses. Hi, I don't know much of the techy stuff, my husband does, but I do know we only used them about 5 times before our tv broke.

"Hello, I'm interested in your 3D glasses. Hi, I don't know much of the techy stuff, my husband does, but I do know we only used them about 5 times before our tv broke.  They are in perfect condition and have never been dropped. Okay, sounds good. How does $30 sound? You're getting 4 pairs!  I don't think $10 each is too much.  Plus they still have some battery life in them. Are they rechargeable? As I mentioned I don't know the techy stuff, but I imagine you could google them to see.  I'm sorry...  You will not be able to find these for less than $15 each. To be honest I only need a single pair. So how about I only take one for $20? Ok, I guess my husband won't be too upset with me for breaking them up.  $20 for 1 it is! Thanks.","Hello, I'm interested in your 3D glasses.

"Hello. I saw your ad about the bike. What are you looking for for it? It is an entry level racing bike and I am asking $800 that is negotiable. Hmm, I think that's a little more than I'm looking to pay right now... I feel like I could probably get a new one for that price. I am looking more in the $300 price range. I could do $500 and deliver it to you.  It has new tires and upgraded seat for comfort. The delivery is an attractive feature. How about this - make it $450 with delivery and we have a deal. I can do that. Email me your addy and I will bring it to you.","Hello. I saw your ad about the bike. What are you looking for for it?

The lowest I can go is $2000. Ok I can wait until tomorrow and I can offer $1300 cash and I will arrange to have all carpets shampooed and a deep clean done at the end of my lease. If you take care of the lawn too and I will have to turn off the security system. It's a deal!  I will arrange for lawn service monthly. Great. <sep> Thanks!"

"hello! Hi! Are you interested in my apartment listing. I am! Unfortunately I'm more in the budget for a space priced around $647. Have I mentioned that this amazing apartment comes with parking, and is within walking distance to BART? The view isn't much and it does have a lot of Sec 8 people but is fairly priced for it's size and location. I'll bottom line it for ya. I need the lease and am willing to cover your moving expenses and knock $300 off the monthly lease price. That sounds like a great deal. I think I could swing $995 provided I get the part in an upcoming live animation simpsons film I've auditioned for. I actually know the director! I'll put in a good word for you.","hello! Hi!

"Hello are you interested in the listing? Hi, yes, it seems to be just a bit out of my price range though. What is the price you would be interested in? Well, I was wondering about the location and the number of bedrooms. How many people can it sleep comfortably? This is a dual master so that means it has two master bedrooms. You could fit 3 in each bed so 6 people total. Well it would just be my wife and me. It will be nice to have the guest room too. We have no pets. Everything else about it sounds great, except that we have to commute to the city for work. We were thinking something more along the $2500-2800 range for a suburban home. If you contract to stay in the home for a  year we could bring the rent to $2800 a month. That seems reasonable enough. The guest room won't be used often except when our parents come from out of town. They aren't messy but your price sounds fair enough. Perfect I'll start on the paperwork.","Hello are you interested in the listing? Hi, yes, it seems to be just a bit out of my price range though. What is the price you would be interested in?

I see that you are listing it at 300. However, I can buy a new one for that. Honestly, without any sort of warranty available and the fact that it is used-I can do 150. it actually still has over 10 months of the warranty that comes with the bike when you buy it. I will not go as low as 150. I can do 225 though. Usually a warranty doesn't transfer if you sell it. I can do 200. if you have any problems with it, within the next 10 months save my number. I can do 200. you will pick up tonight? Sure, I can do that.","Hi. I am interested in your bicycle. How long have you had it for? i have hadit for a little over a month.

It's in perfect condition! I've only had it for a few years.  It's from a non-smoking/non-pet home.  I'm only selling because I'm moving and can't take it with me. Okay, Will you deliver or must I pick up? I can deliver if you're willing to pay full price of $600.  Will that work for you? I will need to pick up then, I do not have $600 at the moment. I can do $550. That works for me! . <sep> Great, Thank you so much"

"Hi there!  I'm selling my Bridgetone 16"" bike.  It's in good condition and available for only $110.  Are you interested? I am very interested but that price is a bit high. What condition is th ebike in. It's in good condition.  It has always been stored indoors, so no rust or chipping. Are the tires in good condition? I see they are original ones. They are the original, but to be honest, I never rode it very often.  There is still a good amount of tread on them, so there's many more miles to go before they'll need to be replaced. That sounds great. How about we settle for 99 and Ill pick it up today. That works for me!","Hi there!  I'm selling my Bridgetone 16"" bike.  It's in good condition and available for only $110.
