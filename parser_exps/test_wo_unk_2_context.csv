"I'm interested in your laser pointer that you've got for sale of course! We're selling it for $35. It has mini USB reciever, comfortable hand control, and ergonomic side grips. Also, low power consumption. That sounds great. I was hoping for a white one, but the black will do. Would you be able to come down a little on the price... say $28? I guess we can come down a tad bit. However we can only do $30 since we need to pay for your free shipping. I hope you understand. Thanks for shopping.

We are currently leasing studios at $979 a month but I'm willing to bargain with you if you can move in soon. Wait your studios are the same price as your 2 bed 2 bath how does that work?,inquiry
