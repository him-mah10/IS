hello is the phone still available ?
I see the home speakers you are selling and I am interested in buying them from you . Ok , great ! They are great speakers . Brand new in box . Great ! I can offer you $ 349 and can pick up ASAP .
It 's a year old . Bought it brand new last July . That all sounds pretty good , would you be willing to negotiate on the price , I can pick it up in person if that helps ... I 'm asking $ 250 for the bike , and pick up would be ideal .
Awesome , that is good to hear ... I know it is listed as $ 12 but I would like to offer $ 8 with me coming to pick it up from you instead to cut down on shipping costs . I don 't remember how much I paid for this , but I think it was around $ 70 . $ 8 is just a little too low . I would take $ 10 for it . Is that acceptable ? Yes , $ 10 would be perfectly fine !
I am willing to meet you in the middle at $ 1100 and I can come and pick it up today . Okay , if you 're willing to show up with $ 1100 , I think we 'll be able to make a deal . Sound good , $ 1000 it is .
The girls bike is purple . Ok , you ay the seats are coming apart , do you mean the vinyl is ripped , or are they coming off of the frame ? The vinyl is just ripped up .
Ok , you ay the seats are coming apart , do you mean the vinyl is ripped , or are they coming off of the frame ? The vinyl is just ripped up . Ok , are the chains in good shape , frames bent ?
I 'm sorry , no . $ 140 is as low as I 'm willing to go . I have a few others interested in the set . Can you bud ge a little bit more ? I am on a strict budget ! $ 125 and we got a deal !!! I shouldn 't , but I accept your offer .

Hi , I am interested in the apartment . Is there a lease ? Is it located in a good neighborhood ?
great ! im interested in buying it but was wondering how old it is . I bought it at a fle a market about a year ago so I am not sure . okay , and does it come with light bul bs already in or do i need to buy my own ?
How many square feet is the apartment ? It 's 1100 square feet . Well , what 's the neighborhood like ?
I was hoping closer to $ 1000 . I 'm sorry that wouldn 't be possible for this particular unit . The lowest we could go for this specific unit , taking into account your concerns about availability of laundry facilities , would be closer to 1500 . Could $ 14 00 work ?
It is , I was thinking a bit lower , around 30 . I could pick it up myself . That 's awesome . I think that is a fair offer , but I can only go down to 40 . I could do 40 , if you offer a warranty inc ase it breaks as soon as I get it home .
Well , let 's negotiate a price we can both agree to . I am willing to pay $ 29 as that fits my budget just now . Friend , you 're going to be getting access to the most exciting international programming and the most b izz are international pornography , I think we can do a little better than $ 29 .
Did anyone own it before you ? I am the only owner . I would like to sell it for $ 800 . How does that price sound to you ? I was hoping closer to $ 600 . Is there any room to work ?
HI !!! I have a vintage console for sale for $ 50 . 00 if you are interested ,.

Good sir . Thank you . I 'm interested in this I phone . You are selling it for parts ? Correct ? Yes that is right it has been disabled . Are the parts in working condition ?
No , the 200 would stay for the length of your lease and then would go up or stay the same based upon rental rates once you re up your lease . we are also offering 1 / 2 off security deposit at this time . Hmm ok . I notice it says " Hard wood - style " floor ing , that means it is lam inate right ? Yes that is correct .
If you are willing to pay full price , I 'll pay the utilities . I am willing to pay $ 11 65 . How about $ 1200 ?
P ossibly , it depends on what you are offering . Well it is technically used , how about 240 . It is used , but it is in great condition . I could do $ 260 .
Too high for a car with so many miles . They are nearly all highway miles though , and it 's been well taken care of . 27 00 .

3 k is too low , I can come down to 4000 . How about 35 00 ? 38 00 and I 'll include the new sound system I bought for it but didn 't install yet .
45 each is too low . What if I come down to $ 60 each ? Well , it 's not a bad price , but I will have to pay someone to deliver them to my house since I don 't have a truck . And they are black , which means I have to rep aint them to match the office . What about $ 50 ? $ 55 and we have a deal .
s ounds good i need something like this for my back $ 40 is kind of steep can i make you a offer for $ 24 . How about 35 , it works fantastic . i can do 30 that 's all i have .

It is new , and I have the in red , and also in amber . how many modes does it fe a uture ? It has 7 different modes of flashing and scanning .

I think I can deal with transportation . How about $ 100 for it ? 100 is way too low for this quality . I can go as low as 175 . I understand you want to get the best price for yourself . How about $ 150 ?
I think $ 20 , 000 is out of the question for a 10 year old car . She does look nice indeed however the new model costs not much more . Can you come down more to around $ 6 , 000 ? $ 6000 is way too low and the only reason why I am selling her is because I have some loans that I have to pay off . I can give it for $ 18 000 . Look there 's just no way . If you could do $ 12 000 that 's still $ 2000 over my budget .
hi , is the house still available ?
This seems like it will fit perfectly on my patio space . I would love to come by and see it . Sure , when would be a good time ? I wanted to see if you would accept $ 112 for it ?

Can you take $ 7 for it ? That 's all I can come up with now . Would you be able to buy it right now ? Yes I can pay right now if you can accept my offer .
It 's pretty new I 've only had it for like a year and it 's been kept in a room no one really uses . No signs of wear and tear . Could I give you 250 for it .

Well , are there any problems with the apartment ? No it is in excellent condition ! Well , I am interested . I 'd like to pay $ 16 30 .
F unny story actually . My neighbor backed over my old one so his insurance bought be a new one . My son is too old for it now so the one that i am selling is brand new , has never even been used . Oh my ! Well , I am a single mother and my child could really use this . Would you be willing to come down on the price considering you got a brand new replacement for your used one ? actually I had pulled out the old one to sell and was going to ask $ 100 for that one so that is why I am asking that for this one . But how much were you thinking ?
Can we meet in the middle ? $ 1600 ? How about 1500 ? Great !
Well , then I 'd be taking a gamble on it . I 've had other ubiqu ity a ps and half the time I can flash them and half the time they 'll just brick . So I suppose I 'd be willing to take a gamble and offer you $ 30 . I cannot go that low . I still have the original box and all the parts . 55 ? I 'd step up to $ 40 if that would help you out at all , but I just can 't see going any higher on something that might brick on me the first time I try to use it . So , $ 40 , and I 'd be willing to come pick it up so you don 't have to mail it .
Don ; t forget , internet is included and you are close to cafes and restaurants . For you , I will give you 2 months off for a 2 year contract and 15 % off the initial price ! Thank you but i still can not afford that price . i can offer you $ 900 per month and would be willing to sign a 2 year lease . Let me offer you something more too cause I see you like the studio . How about $ 1200 and no deposit ? That 's really as steal !!
We only have 2 and 3 bedrooms available ! That 's too bad , I 'm on a tight budget . Would you be willing to accept me for $ 600 per month ? There is unfortunately no way for me to lower the price that low but , what I can do for you is waive the pet deposit and give you 3 visits free to our pet spa . You can also save money by cance lling your gym membership since we have one on - site included in your monthly rent !
Please come and take this couch out of my life ! Is the couch still in good condition and where was it stored ?

Is something wrong with it and that 's why you are selling it ? Nothing is wrong with the bike at all . I have gotten a bit bigger and I am not riding it as much . I need money to save up for a new one that will fit me . Do you think this would be good for a person who is around 5 ' 5 "?

Yes . I was just looking for dimensions . Can you give me an estimate for how large it is ? It is about 17 inches wide and 5 inches high . I have never purchased an item of this nature before . Would you be willing to come down in price to $ 85 ?
Wow ! Any way to get that closer to 2500 ? For a 2 year lease , I could drop to $ 3 200 . We include garden maintenance for free . How about 28 00 ? I will pay the first month in cash .
Hello , Are you willing to negotiate on price ? $ 40 is too much . Actually the ad says the seat is for sale at $ 50 . But I may be winning to come down on the price if you 're willing to provide your own transportation . Oops sorry my mistake that was a typo ! I would be willing to pay $ 35 . I have cash in hand and will pick it up today .
I can take 20 % off . That would bring the price to $ 160 , and we can deliver it to you . I can w iggle up to $ 100 and pick it up myself . I 'm sorry , no . $ 140 is as low as I 'm willing to go . I have a few others interested in the set .
The master bedroom has a walk - in closet , very spacious . great i love the features can you let me in for say 23 91 . Can we make it an even 2400 ?
Yes correct . what 's the lasting power ? It has a 12 v power source so it lasts for hours and hours !
Hello , I love the way this item looks , but the price is kind of expensive for me . Well this is a unique piece , original var n ish . I would like to pay 365 for it , because I am on a tight budget , are there any features or bonuses that make it worth more than that ??
hello I am interested in the y uk on you are selling . That 's great ! It 's an excellent car and in great condition . I 'm asking $ 4 , 400 . My family and I have gotten a lot of use out of it over the years . I 'm only selling since two of the kids have gone on to college so I don 't need such a big vehicle anymore .

I 'm sure you could find a tele comm uting position . Lol . All right good point will you go down on the price ? What did you have in mind ? $ 25 is a steal for the mattress of your dreams : - ).
Hello I am very interested in this dress er and I am willing to offer $ 250 . O uch .. That is a little bit too low . It is an antique draw ers from my great grandma and I would like to sell it for at least 400 . It is lovely . Call it $ 300 and you have a deal .
Yes there are coin operated machines available . sorry I mist yp ed do you know the cost per load of the machines at the building ? No sorry I am not positive what the most current prices are and wouldn 't want to give you out of date information . It would be standard prices as any other laundry facility .
Do ing great , how are you ? I 'm doing good , I have a bike here that I 'm trying to sell , are you interested ? It has definitely caught my eye . It 's a little higher than my price range , but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle .
What year was it purchased ? It was purchased in 2012 . Why are you getting rid of it now ?
For a 12 month lease , I could take 2000 . It 's a great deal for the amenities ! If I sign an agreement stating that I will be responsible for ALL the home repairs to unit for 12 months . . . .. . . Can you accept $ 13 00 for the monthly rent ? I definitely can 't go down to 1300 . With said agreement , I could go down to 1600 . That is the lowest I can go in these un ites at all .
Hello . That is a great question but unfortunately I do not know who the artist is . I only know it is Danish in design . has it been in a smoking environment ? No . It has been in a non - smoking environment , also free of pets or any other strong od ors . It is clean and in like new condition .
How about 35 , it works fantastic . i can do 30 that 's all i have . I can take 30 . You will love it .

I could go down to $ 3000 is that reasonable for you ? sounds good deal . Great !
Hello .
Hey if I pay for my own utilities , will you take $ 14 00 a month ?
I will be upfront with you . My budget is $ 32 50 , do you have any w iggle room on the price of $ 65 00 ? I can definitely work with you on the price , why don 't you come out and have a look at the car . if you are willing to do a deal for cash , i 'd be willing to go down to $ 59 00 . $ 59 00 is definitely too high still . I would be willing to do $ 4000 cash with a 100 , 000 mile warranty and free oil changes for a year . Final offer .
I 'm int e reset ed in these speakers . How much are you asking for them ?
Okay . And how old are the brakes and shocks ? They are the same age as the bike so about 2 years old . I 'll throw in the spare tire that I haven 't gotten around to putting on yet if you 're willing to buy the bikes . Sure , would you take $ 45 for them >.
Or , if it helps , I can take the $ 2 , 250 as a deposit and hold for you for a month so you can come up with the rest of the money . That 's too steep for me at this time . I still would have to make sure it is road worthy . That 's really nice of you but I will need that month to get it ready for her to take to college . Ok , let me know if you change your mind . I would love to help you out , but I can 't go for half of what I 'm asking .
Hi how are you doing ?

What are you insane ? My boyfriend is so gay , we never even used this thing , he bought it and treated it like a grandmother . That explains the pattern of the chair . I am going to have to pay to get it re - uph ol st ered so I am taking that cost into account . $ 30 is about the most I can offer taking that into account . Baby , you don 't ne eeee ee ed to re - uph ol ster this chair , but you want too . Which I admire . I have it listed for $ 50 , but the only way you are going to get it for $ 30 is taking me on a date , which he won 't care .

Would you take 300 ? i 'm afraid that is a little low , but i 'm willing to work with you . if you come and pick it up , I 'd be willing to let go of if for $ 475 . this fine wal nut dress er is worth it .
I 'm wondering if there is anything wrong with this ? I clipped a deer with it a few months ago , but paid to have it repaired and it 's been 5 by 5 since then . Nice . Does it have a lot of miles ?

I 'm really interested in this . Are you the original owner ? I have 5000 cash I can give you tomorrow .
That 's great ! Could you do $ 45 each ? 45 each is too low . What if I come down to $ 60 each ? Well , it 's not a bad price , but I will have to pay someone to deliver them to my house since I don 't have a truck . And they are black , which means I have to rep aint them to match the office .

I 'm asking only $ 150 for it but willing to negotiate if the price is right . Sounds good . I have a limited budget . What 's the least you 'll accept for it ? I can go as lot as $ 125 and you have to pick it up . It 's a great bike , you can 't overlook this one !

i am extremely interested ! but the price is just a bit too steep . I am still leasing my current apartment and am paying rent there as well , but i would love to move in as soon as possible . Is it possible that we can lower the price to $ 119 7 ? If so , i could absolutely give a down payment as soon as this negotiation is over ! Can 't go lower than 1500 , as there is a pool as well as appliances being included in the asking price . I only have 1300 to my name right now , would that be acceptable ?
ser iously ? yeah dude I really need the st ools but cant make it to the bank in time , would be amazing if you could do 45 , or something else we could work out ? id k . retail is 79 . 99 so obviously I am not selling them for $ 45 .
I am . what size is it ? We have multiple sizes av a ible to lease , our most popular option is the 2 bedroom , 2 bath option and that includes full utilities . oh ok so is it the 2 / 2 that is 9 79 ?
I have a 2000 withdrawal limit at my bank and with what I have now , I can pay 2 200 in cash and come pick it up now . It 's a little less than I had hoped , but that works : - ). great .
I 'd like to spend as little as possible . Has it ever been in a accident ? A minor f ender - bender , but it 's since been repaired , so it 's un notice able . The Blue book value on this car is 10 k . Would that be the new blue book value or used blue book value ?
Hello I hear that you 're looking for a good bike ?
I was hoping to find something with less miles on it but i could buy one with 160 k for $ 2 , 000 . Would you accept that offer ? I think we can find a middle ground here pretty easy , could you come pick it up ? I 'd take 2500 for it if you could . I have a 2000 withdrawal limit at my bank and with what I have now , I can pay 2 200 in cash and come pick it up now .
It sounds good , although I do believe the models with recharge able batteries are superior . Coin batteries are often expensive and difficult to find . Will you accept $ 25 ? I can pick up immediately . Actually the coin batteries allow this to have a smaller size so it 's very compact . It 's worth 35 . I can maybe lower it to 30 if that helps you out . 30 is acceptable to me . Thank you .

Sorry , can 't do $ 170 . I know it 's a great phone and will sell for close to what I 'm asking . I can 't go that high . Sorry . I 'd like to buy a case since I really don 't care for silver , but can 't if I pay the whole amount . How about $ 200 ? That is still quite a bit lower than I 'm willing to accept . My final offer is $ 250 . That will give you some extra to buy a case .
Yes it will hold a small fireplace . The glass is tempered so it would be excellent for that purpose . I am prepared to offer $ 95 , assuming the chairs are in good condition . The chairs are in excellent condition but 95 . 00 is pretty low . How about 120 ?

I own my own construction company . I would be able to have my crew fix any repairs as long as I 'm living there , FREE OF CHAR GE ! That would save you hundreds , maybe thousands over the year !

Wh ats the best we can do for the monthly price for this unit ? Hello , I can negotiate a bit . This is a very large , very nice apartment with a large den , as well as free access to a fitness room and a rec room . There is also an indoor pool . Were you looking for an 8 or 12 month lease ?
It is in very good shape with only a couple of n icks on the top , as shown . It is about 2 years old . $ 250 seems a little high , I could get a brand new one for not much more . Would you take $ 180 ? The price I paid was quite a bit higher , and it comes with an extra glass door . I would take $ 220 , since it is in very good shape .
nice truck i want it .

Are you interested in my dining room table . i am , whats a lazy sus an ?
It has not had any water damage at all . The phone is in like new condition . Okay , I would like to offer $ 54 . I am really hoping to get the full $ 60 but I can do $ 54 if you are willing to pick up the item .
Not bad ! how much ? $ 5 each ! How about 8 total ? Package deal .
Great , what questions do you have ? How many miles are on it ? 32 , 000 miles , it usually just sits around most of the time . I would consider it my Sunday fund ay car .
I can come pick it up from you , but Saturn is no longer in business so servicing of it can get difficult , id like to pay 1200 for it . that 's way way low than what I am asking for . Its fully serv iced and in a great condition . I can give it to you for 2500 . yeah but the company does not exist , and the car is 15 years old . parts are difficult to get in the event something goes wrong . How about 1500 ?
Hey ! Saw your listing for the 2 mag na bikes and would be interested in them for my kids . Looks like a little damage on them though . Would you be able to part with them for $ 15 ? Not to much damage . Main ly need tire tubes and the seats have a little wear . I was trying to ger $ 25 out of them . Yeah , it 's the seats and tubes I was looking at . I 'd have to get new ones . I 'd be willing to meet you at $ 20 and I will pick up if you will replace one of the two , whichever is cheapest for you .
Yes it does . Okay , great ! I am very interested in it . Are you willing to come down any on the price ? I would be willing to meet today with cash in hand . Yes , sure . How much are you hoping to spend on it ?
It is new . The only issue is that the top drawer sticks a little bit and requires effort to open and close . ok i am inter sted .. how about 35 . I 'm sorry , I can 't go that low . I am willing to take 20 % off if you purchase it today . That brings the price down to $ 60 . Like I said , it 's pretty much brand new , and well below retail price .

Hi I am interested in your apartment which size is 2 172 . This is the 2 and 3 bedrooms , is this in your range ?
It is a mirrored night stand , which is really fashionable . T He night stand is a little bit damaged as the top drawer has a little bit of resistance while using it .

Hmm yeah that still leaves me with the same problem since the kids will be in school longer than 2 years . I could save up for a better place in the same school district if the price was a bit lower . Ye a , thats up to you . I 'm looking for 37 00 , but I would be willing to willing with you . Well all things considered I think I could do $ 31 50 . How does that sound ?
Hi , I just saw your ad and I 'm really interested . when can I come and take it for a test ride ? Just let me know when you want to come and I will be available . IT rides like new I know you will love it ! Maybe tomorrow afternoon . Is there anything wrong with it ? Why are you selling ?
hello , what is your offer ?
She 's my baby , so I 'm a little higher than that on price . She 's still got plenty of life left on her . How about I throw in my snow tires that I was going to sell separately , and we call it 3 200 ? that 's still way above my range . can you do 27 50 ? that 's the max i can go . I think we 're a ways off . The lowest I 'm willing to go is 3000 with the tires .
1800 its fair common . Its a whole car not just some parts . alright deal ! Great !
Hi I am interested in your apartment which size is 2 172 . This is the 2 and 3 bedrooms , is this in your range ? Oh so the three bedroom is the same price great . Well it is a bit out of my price range does it include any utilities or anything ?
Okay how does it run ? Any problems with it ? and how old is it ? It is in perfect condition . I bought it brand new 6 years ago . Every single thing on it works perfect . I have over $ 3000 invested in it . Sounds good okay . So how much mileage is on it ?
Yeah but 25 is not worth what you 're getting . We need to be on a middle ground here . I might pay $ 40 . Can you bring it to my house ? I can bring it but in next two weeks not anytime soon .

Hi , you 're interested in leasing ?
Hi , I should say right away that I 'm on a strict budget . Okay , Let 's see what we can do for you . How many bedrooms do you need ? Awesome ! I only need 2 .
Not too bad . It is a bit fur led at the edges . I see . Well generally 500 is kind of a premium price on r ugs of this style . Do you have any room on the price ? A little bit . What are you willing to offer ?
I couldn 't go down all that low . It 's worth at least 1800 in this condition as I 've seen many sold at that price . Mine is priced to sell quickly so it 's already been lowered . 1400 good ? I looked at your ad again and noticed all of the upgrades . I can do $ 14 00 . Could I pick it up at the bike shop so I can get some accessories while I am there ? Yes and great that works just fine . 1400 it is .
i do a dog . W Ill that be a problem . Not at all ! We welcome pets , but there is an additional pet deposit required . No additional monthly pet fee . ok sounds good to me . I could go 2500 . Is that ok with you .
What kind of wood are they ? If I pick them up tonight would you take $ 200 ? I nice dark pine wood and I would like to make a deal but I would only go as low as 350 . I don 't know if I could come up to that . They nice but I was hoping to keep it under $ 300 .
I would love that !! Excellent , excellent . The legs come off , so it 'll be really easy to transport . I 'll tell you what -- I can even haul it for you in my truck if you can get it today . That s great ! How much are you asking for it ?
hi , is the apt available ? Yes ! This beautiful unit is available for $ 2200 .

does it work with any phone ? It should work with any standard telephone , yes . ok would you take $ 46 for it ? I will pick it up myself .

Hi I am interested in buying your rug can you tell me more about it . Sure . It measures 2 . 8 by 6 , the picture does not do th ia rug justice . Its gorgeous ! I can see that . how old is it ? what is the condition ?
8 , 500 is way higher than blue book value for a 1995 . I am interested but at a more reasonable price . I would be willing to go a little bit lower . How about 8000 ? I would offer you $ 5 , 500 .
Okay , and are pets not allowed at all ? Or is there a fee for having a pet ? I am sorry but pets are not allowed . Okay . Now this is a bit out of my price range budget wise . I 'm a professional artist so anything I can save is choice . Is it at all possible to rent this unit for 800 . Compar able apartments in the area are running at around 850 .
Really ? Do you know where they are ranked ? They 're award winning , and within walking distance . A real plus for families . Great ! What else is in the neighborhood ?
Hello , yes it is . Ok sweet . From the photo , it still looks new in the box . Is it ? Yes , it is new I just opened it to try it .

Hello , I am interested in this car .
Hi ! Are you interested in the night stand I 'm selling ? how old is this .
of course ! We 're selling it for $ 35 . It has mini USB rec iever , comfortable hand control , and erg onomic side grips . Also , low power consumption . That sounds great . I was hoping for a white one , but the black will do . Would you be able to come down a little on the price ... say $ 28 ? I guess we can come down a tad bit . However we can only do $ 30 since we need to pay for your free shipping . I hope you understand . Thanks for shopping .
It means the car 's emissions were checked to see if they were up to EPA standards , and they are . Ok , excellent . Glad to hear it . $ 35 00 is still a bit out of my price range though ... Any other used car you find in this price range is going to be a complete rust bucket . This car is fully functional , and the AC even still works .
I mean it was used once , I 'd probably take 160 for it , because it cost me 250 originally . If I pay in cash and pick it up today , could you do $ 150 ? 155 and pleasure doing business with you .
It 's a great bike , but it 's a little too small for me . I need to sell . Is it for adults or kids ? It 's not a kid 's bike . It 's 56 cm , which is around average size .

Yeah it 's got to go to the right buyer , someone that will cherish it 's uniqueness . I 'll give you 18 . I could settle on 22 dollars if it 's cash . ok 22 is a deal .
Hello , I see you are interested in my home for rent , correct ? I am looking for $ 23 95 . 00 per month . How does this work for you ? Not quite . I 'd love to buy it , I really need a place . But I can only afford $ 2000 , would that work ? I still have to pay for mo vers and everything , so I really need to save some cash here . I could perhaps give a little w iggle room in this price , If you re signing the 12 month lease , I could do say $ 2200 ?
Hi . Is this bicycle rusty ? Hi ! How are you ? The bike isn 't rusty and is in great condition . However , the pedals are not included . Okay good . Are the pedals easy to find or will I have to special order them ?

Hello .
That just means that it can 't be react ivated on any cell phone plan . I see . In that case , would you be willing to take 30 dollars for it ? All the parts are in really good shape they just aren 't communicating well together . I 'd go down to $ 45 if you were able to come pick the phone up .
That is a bit out of our range , considering we would have to purchase new furniture . It 's well worth the money . Does it come furnished at all ?

It is if I were in Best Buy . LOL I see your point , but this system has been sitting at your house for half of a year .... That 's why I 'm offering it at 40 % off . I can throw in a small TV stand to house it if you are willing to pay the asking price . That price is a bit high for me . Would you consider $ 200 cash ? If this was a gift from someone to you for Christmas , it is like getting free money and freeing up some space ....
and the chair covers are there any stains on them ? No stains on the chair covers and they are wash able and replace able if you do happen to stain them . would i have to pick it up or do you deliver ?
Hello are you interested in this unit ? Yes how much is the parking ? Parking is an extra $ 200 per month .
That 's great to hear , do you know what kind of wood it is made of ? I actually am not sure , but I looked it up and to the best of my knowledge it looks like western red c edar . How exotic . Would you be willing to lower the price about $ 20 since we don 't know for sure what kind of wood ?

Hello , I seen your rug posted and I am very int rest ed in it . Are there any noticeable signs of wear ?
Okay my budget is around $ 600 how does that sound ? 600 is way too low , look how much the tri ke has , custom sound , al pine speakers , J VC amp , the excellent condition , etc . Okay in that case would you do 950 .
what model I phone ? It 's an unlocked 7 . It 's worth over 600 right now . I have no use for it an I 'm in the market for a TV . I have really wanted one of those , as long as it is not locked you have a deal .

Hi this is a great memorial Car . Are you interested in owing it as i now want to give it up . Yes , I believe this would be a great additional to our collection . I do see it needs some work . Would you consider cash payment of $ 3 , 900 and I can pick up in the morning also . The cost of the work needed is quite insignificant . I can consider offering you a discount of 700 to cover the services . Can we have a deal of $ 4 200 ?
Hey I 'm pretty interested in the lamp looks really good . Thank you for your interest . Any questions I can answer for you ? How long have you had it and are there any damages or scratches also is the shade very secure on the lamp ?
Hi .
Would you take $ 100 ? 100 I don 't know , I 've already lowered the price so it could sell faster because I need the money for remod eling . It 's worth a lot more than 120 . You could sell today $ 100 cash .
Nice , I 'll give you 10 k cash . Considering the year and features that is just too low . Can you do better than that ? 12 k is the Kelly Blue Book value so i 'm gonna have to stop there .
I 'm selling this car for just 8 500 ! 8 , 500 is way higher than blue book value for a 1995 . I am interested but at a more reasonable price .

Hi I saw your post for the printer . How old is it ?
I am having a move out sale . Ike a 4 drawer chest , excellent condition . Originally 120 , asking 75 . I am interested but $ 75 is a lot for a used chest . How is $ 50 ?
Since I want $ 930 ( price at $ 20 less so you can purchase new pedals ) and you want $ 860 , how about we meet directly in the middle at $ 8 95 ? 8 95 is a bit more than I wanted to spend and the bike is 10 years old . How about 8 80 cash and I 'll come pick it up today ? How about $ 8 90 and I will deliver it to you ?
GO right ahead . When was the TV purchased ? about 6 months ago .
Sorry but I don 't think we will be able to make a deal if you aren 't willing to pay at least 1800 . I can offer additional things but you will need to afford that as minimum ? well it would depend on what else you can include . I can include all your utilities , internet , can offer swimming pool and business center . Also 24 hour maintenance with laundry conc ier ge available for 50 extra . I can give you access to the clubhouse for 75 extra per month which will include Google Fiber speed internet , bill i ards , large TVs and social groups . What do you think ?
Well , the service record is as clean as they come . You shouldn 't need any major repairs . New tires , fresh battery ... I can go down to $ 72 50 . i can offer you $ 5000 . This is a top of the line car with all of the bells and whist les - roof rack , sun ro of , GPS , backup camera , premium sound system . It 's ready to go . I 'll go to $ 7 000 .
Did you have a lot of fun with the car ? Yes , I loved it !!! Great car ! It looks like it has a full package . Is there anything that needs repairing ?

Wow , nice , but I would need closer to 1 , 000 . $ 12 50 ? It 's a great tri ke and I 've upgraded so many aspects of it . how about 11 50 ?
It is in excellent condition . It has only been driven by me . It has never been in an accident . Okay , well if it 's such a great car , why are you trying to sell it ? I needed a larger vehicle for my family .

Yes Its available . the condition is great and features many upgrade . I see that . It is a beautiful bike . I don 't want to seem che ep , but I just moved up here in this area and I am looking for a good bike to ride the mountain trails . My budget only stands at $ 550 , will you be able to take my offer ? I appreciate your offer but it is really much too low . this bike is light weight , has new components and has hardly been used . I would like an offer close to $ 1000 .

I understand you have repaired the bike to almost new condition . Oh yes , like the ad says , it came to us a total mess . But with new chain , hydro lic disk breaks , a new seat and tires , the bike rides like a champ . I 'm asking $ 250 for it and its well worth that price . That is a little high for me . Would you take $ 215 ?
I 'd like to get $ 600 for the bike .
I 'm doing just fine , thanks for asking . I 'm selling this great bike for $ 375 . Its high quality and has been custom painted . It is just too small for my build . I see it looks pretty nice , so there is nothing wrong with it ?
this is a perfect little studio for ber ke ly students . you can walk to classes . Hi I 'm allergic to pollen so the outside without my car or other protective gears is not an option for me . I was hoping that you could tell me about the apartment inside , is it clean and also I cannot pay 1500 total , are you able to go down and or guarantee the air is nice ?
Is your price neg ot iable ? I 'm very interested . Price is neg ot iable . Glad to hear you 're very interested , it is a great town house . Would you consider 23 40 $ ?
Yes ! I 'm interested in one of your sea - fo am green ones . What 's your starting price ? I am asking $ 45 , they are in very good condition . H mmm , that 's a bit high for me . Would you be willing to go lower if I came by to pick it up myself ?

Great , I 'm asking $ 165 for it . Considering it isn 't the latest model , I think $ 165 is a little unreasonable . I was thinking around $ 80 would be fair . It may not be the latest model but it 's in great working condition , well cared for and professionally stored it is in new condition in box . I 'm unable to go lower than $ 125 .
What is the lowest price you can go ? If you can come today . I can drop it down to $ 35 00 . That 's still to high for me . The highest I can go is $ 26 56 .
Hi , I don 't know much of the tech y stuff , my husband does , but I do know we only used them about 5 times before our tv broke . They are in perfect condition and have never been dropped . Okay , sounds good . How does $ 30 sound ? You 're getting 4 pairs ! I don 't think $ 10 each is too much . Plus they still have some battery life in them .
I can leave the furniture and furnish ings there for you to use . Would that ent ice you to pay 28 00 ? Yes , the furniture is a good deal as well . Could we settle on 27 00 ? Perhaps . Are you willing to come and take a tour ?
It is sued e . Price include delivery ? where are you located ? Yes , The least I will go is 100 . I am located downtown right on the border .
Our 2400 unit is a three bedroom . Ok great it is just my husband and I so we only need 1 bedroom how much are those ? The 1 bedroom unit is 2000 .
What is your bottom dollar for this set ? I would like to stay close to asking if possible . What did you have in mind ? It is a pretty good deal for so many pieces . I was thinking closer to $ 450 . I could come tomorrow with cash in hand .

Looking to sell this phone ASAP . Awesome , I am looking to buy a phone so hopefully we can reach a deal . Does it have any scratches on it ? It has one tiny scratch on the back . Function ality is flawless .
Well , what can you tell me about it ? Aside from what 's in the post , I 'm also going to cover lawn maintenance and utilities . I 'm only asking $ 25 99 for all of that . Well , are there any problems with the property ?
Awesome ! I only need 2 . Great , I could do a 2 Bed room w / all the amazing amenities for $ 1 , 500 . D ang .. I am forced to move away from my old place because I can 't afford it at 13 25 ... I was hoping to pay something more like 800 - 1000 . Is that at all possible ?
How are the tires on this bike ? They are only slightly worn . I just changed them maybe 3 months ago . Is something wrong with it and that 's why you are selling it ?

How about $ 37 ? That 's a little bit too low . I could go down to 55 $ ? How about $ 50 ? I can come get it from you also if you don 't deliver it ?
Yes . That is perfect actually . The list price is way out of my budget though . I could do $ 13 00 today . The price may be higher than you 're used to seeing listed because all appliances are included . Stainless steel fridge , stove , dish washer , microwave and was her and dry er . I understand . Can you go any lower at all ?
Hello , I 'm interested in your night stand . Is it in good condition ?
I am willing to drive but I 'm not local . For that reason I want it at least 345 . If you can be here tomorrow , I will do 345 . I have new furniture coming and need it gone as ap . Deal .
well I bung led this . I wanted $ 75 , but I thought better of it with the damage . You must pick up , though . How much you said again ? $ 15 is my bottom - bar rel . I won 't go lower , and you must pick up and take yourself .
It is in great condition , and does not have any damages ! Would you like to purchase this fine piece of equipment ! How about $ 10 ? I will not go lower than $ 15 my friend .
What is the deposit ? The price for the the 2 bed unit , 950 sq ft is $ 1900 . Will you include garbage and water with that ?

28 00 and you have a deal . 28 00 it is then . can you deliver it to my place please .
I am ! Are there any stains or spots on the top ? Yes there are some chips around edges and some marks on the top surface . Its used so some of it is there . How old is it ?
Ah , quite a shame . It looks a bit worn so I think $ 17 00 is way over priced . No way . It is only four years old . What are you willing to pay for it ? It 's nice but maybe a bit out of my price range . I 'd like to spend $ 1000 or under on my next bike .
Hi , is the Pri us still available ?
Yes it 's still for sale . How does $ 600 sound ? I need it soon . Well the price was already reduced and this is a great couch , very high quality and well kept . How about 6 75 ?
I can make you a sl igh l ty better offer for this excellent studio . It has a full kitchen with gas stove and oven , and plenty of storage room ! I simply can not pay anything near $ 1 , 500 per month . My budget will not allow it . Don ; t forget , internet is included and you are close to cafes and restaurants . For you , I will give you 2 months off for a 2 year contract and 15 % off the initial price !
Hello . Wow what a cool lamp you have for sale ! How much are you asking for it ? Yes , Isn 't cool . I am asking $ 65 for it .
t oy ota 's and h ond as don 't go by k bb . they last forever . and this car was maintained meticulously . that previous ad might have a salvage title . this is a clean title . no d ings , no defects of any kind . and all power . it has 150 , 000 miles on it . Even if it was maintained perfectly that 's a lot of miles . I only need a starter car for my kid so this would be a good one if the price was right . I can go up to 17 50 but that 's near the limit . well yes , but mostly highway miles . wear on the car is very little considering . and 17 50 won 't buy this car . might try another car .

I can include an LED head light if you pay 185 and pick it up .
It may have hard wood floors as represented in the picture . What would you offer ? 12 41 $ was what I had budget ed for , but if I would be allowed to have one cat I would be willing to pay more . Pets are not allowed . What about if we offered water and garbage pickup included , could you do $ 15 33 ?
Sorry , $ 297 doesn 't cover the parts added and bike . Oh I see . How about $ 325 max and I will pick it up ? I can go as low as $ 375 an you pick it up .
Well no this is vintage piece . It 's mid century and is a great vintage condition . and is the color as shown ? Yes the color is as shown . I think it 's very nice and will go with just about any room color or other furniture .

Yes definitely . So , what is your service all about ? Well , lets get down to brass t acks here , you wouldn 't be interested in my service unless you want to get certain channels you wouldn 't get from dish or direct tv . That 's good to know . Now lets get to the real thing here . The price is too high for me . What can we do about it ?
Hello , I 've had the listing up for awhile . The bikes are the same in looks but 1 is a boys and 1 a girls . they are in good shape . I am asking $ 25 for the pair . I see that I will have to purchase new tubes and probably new seats . Due to this , would you be willing to take $ 17 I will come to you for pick up . At your earliest convenience . Since they have been here awhile and I need the space they are taking up , I will accept $ 17 . You can pick them up whenever you want .
Sure , would you take $ 45 for them >. I 'd be open to going down to $ 60 including the additional tire . I could pay $ 50 and pick up and load myself .
How long is the lease for ? One year . Would you be will to lower the price if I sign a 3 year lease ?
Just purchased it , took it out of the box then decided I didn 't want it so it 's brand new . oh ok , so you never used it , how do we know if it works ? It works . If you are serious about buying it we can sk ype and I 'll turn it on for you .
Do you have any questions ? I like what I see . What do you use it for ?
That sounds great , I can stop by today . W O uld you take 35 for the console ? Do you have any watches laying around ? I would take $ 35 with a watch ( working or not ). I sure do , I have a lot of them , some vintage and some newer . I will bring them all and you and you can look through and see what you want I have no use for most of them .
No rust at all , super sturdy too ! Great . I would like to come see them in person . If I was able to come by today and pick them up would you be willing to come down on the price , say $ 90 ? $ 90 seems very reasonable .

Im doing great ! How about you ? I like the coffee table , is it in good shape ? Yes , the coffee table and the two chairs Im tossing in are all in " like - new " condition .

I am glad to hear that you are great ! Well you have to bear in mind that all utilities and internet are included and also you have a full kitchen as well . If you sign a 1 year lease I can give it to you for $ 14 00 . Yeah , that 's still too high ., I can do 2 year lease for 900 , how does that sound ? $ 900 is a bit low for us . We are centrally located so you have a lot of stores nearby . It is a very convenient location and also we have a list of people who are also interested especially because of location . The lowest I am willing to go is $ 13 50 .
That is a bit out of my budget . What is your budget ? 22 80 but I can go higher if there are special amenities .
$ 130 and its yours . what perks does it have . Its comes with 4 matching glasses , a silver tray , & a stainless steel thermal .

Yes , I still have it . do you have any questions ? How old are the tires ? Will they need replacing soon ? The tires are brand new , also the chain was replaced a week ago . It 's a great mountain bike for it being used . It 's been ridden on some nice trails and the frame remains sturdy as ever . I 'm asking only $ 150 for it but willing to negotiate if the price is right .
Yes , you would have to set up an account with a provider after you purchase it . Since the phone says AT & T do I have to contract through AT & T ? If so why don " t we lower the price to 100 . 00 . Yes it has to be AT & T if you keep it " as is ." However , I 'm a hardware engineer and can unlock the phone for you ! That way you can set it up on any network . For that I would ask $ 160 .
Hello ! hello . I am trying to sell my car for $ 4000 , can you see everything in my ad ?

Hello .
Hello ! Were you interested in the apartment ? Hello , yes , I 'm interested in this apartment . Did you have any questions about it .
It is in excellent condition and has no tears or stains . In fact , it has hardly been used . sounds good I would like to offer $ 35 for it and I will come pick it up . I really can 't give it to you for $ 35 . It is an amazing chair , and I am certain I can get more than that for it . How about $ 45 ?
How old are they ? around 6 mo , we bought them when we got the TV and had monthly family movie night . If I come get them today are you willing to take $ 38 . That 's all the cash I have on me .
Yes . But I am looking to pay only $ 15 30 . You can 't just put an offer we need to discuss it first . I only think it is worth 15 30 .
Okay , I don 't have a vehicle to pick it up in . Could you deliver it to my place ? I can pay a little extra for that . What price were you thinking ? Im trying to pay like $ 400 or so . I can deliver , that 's not a problem . I 've already had an offer for $ 450 , though , and it 's only been up for a day . With delivery , I 'd like the price originally offered . Okay , understandable . I can do $ 500 , would that work ?
I see that . Unfortunately , it 's not worth $ 150 . I can probably offer you $ 110 . The lowest I can go is $ 125 because its in really good shape . I will be happy to put a new chain on for you as well . How can I say no to that ? $ 120 and I 'll come pick it up .
Alright , I 'm going to tell you right out of the gate , my budget is very low . I 'm looking at trying to spend around $ 22 50 . I can probably go higher but would have to be something very compelling to go higher ... $ 22 50 is way too low . This car is in good condition . No fading , r ips , tears , no leaks and no check engine lights . It has a backup camera , and the air conditioning is perfect . The car was completely repaired and no trace of damage to the front f ender . Oh wait ... what do you mean " rep aired "? It was in an accident ? That is no good ... I 'm not sure I want a car that has been in an accident ...

It is in really good condition I am asking $ 100 but willing to negotiate for the right price . I was thinking around $ 85 . I have to go purchase a new remote so this will be additional expense and time consuming . I will give you $ 60 . how about I throw in a d vd player and we meet at $ 75 .
Thanks ! It would work for our lifestyle now , but everything is stream lining that I don 't think we 'll be using it for 12 years ! Yes you are right . I can go a little bit lower as I have to get rid of it . How much are you looking to pay for it . I 'd like to pay $ 150 , but all cash . You wouldn 't have to worry about a check bouncing .
Yes please . Ok , without the Sound station , i would sell the two adapters for $ 15 . Sorry I want both I got a little confused . How much for both ? I can afford $ 38 for both please .
It is a little smaller than . it is a good size for a lot of different rooms or uses . Plus much easier to transport . Would you take $ 350 ?
do you have a warranty with it ? No but I dropped the price . It is a great professional bike for people who want to get started riding a real bike . I am inter sted would you accept 400 for it and I could come get it today ?
Hello . Thanks for viewing the listing . It seems like a great rental . Do you have any w iggle room on this listing ? I am looking to pay in the ballpark of $ 1800 . I was looking to get $ 25 51 but I can work with you . I can 't go to $ 1800 , but could you do $ 2200 ?
Good evening , are you interested in this really nice glass office desk ?
Oh wow , if I pick it up today , would you be willing to take $ 261 ? I could do 280 if you can come pick it up today ! $ 270 and you 've got a deal !

Hi ! I 'm interested in your bike . Great ! It 's a nice mountain bike . I am asking $ 150 . I see that . Unfortunately , it 's not worth $ 150 . I can probably offer you $ 110 .
Hello . How are you ?
Okay , well i am interested but 4000 is too expensive for my budget , especially when there is only 1 bath . Ideally , I would like to pay 28 00 for it . There are a lot of additional amenities and I 'd be willing to drop the price , but I 'm unable to go that low . Would you be interested at 35 00 ? I can go to 3 200 . That 's the most my budget would allow .
Certainly ! This property is a beautiful , upgraded single story home in a quiet neighborhood with new carpet , fresh pain and high ceiling throughout . High ceilings , sounds like expensive heating / cool ing bill ... Actually , while this home does have ceiling fans and A / C this home brings not only comfort BUT is energy efficient as well .
How low can you go on the price of the file cabinets ? Well they are in good condition so I don 't want to go too low but what did you have in mind ?
Hello . Nice car .
No , sorry . $ 480 ! 490 final .
Sorry was confused by the picture . Have you used this desk alot ? It was used a little , I bought it thinking I would be able to do some work at home , but then we had our third child , and we need to make the home office a play room . Otherwise , I would be keeping this desk . I loved it . If you can pick up the desk , I w old be willing to sell it for $ 65 . Would you be able to go down to $ 55 to compensate the gas I would use coming to pick it up ?

oh sorry , I am the buyer ! Would you accept $ 1000 ? I can come by today ! it has many new gadgets on it including tires and brakes , so I would not go any lower than $ 1200 . Can you do $ 1100 if I pay cash ? I am just a poor college student !
I would . But first what can you tell me about h tis . It is a beautiful home . build in 2011 , so it 's very new . 3 Bed rooms . 2 . 5 baths . It 's in a great neighborhood . It is a must see . Does it o c me with a home warranty at all .
Ok .. I can come and get it now with $ 77 cash in hand . The lowest I can go for this would be $ 85 . Are you able to do that ? I can go as high as $ 80 . Would that work ??
I would like to pay 7 . 7 dollars is a bit low . How about ten dollars ? 9 and we have a deal !
It is a wonderful bike I 'm moving and will be commuting by subway so i need to get rid of it . Do you have any questions ? I was hoping I could offer $ 125 for it . How old is it , and are there any flaws I need to know about your bike . No no flaws whatsoever i would be willing to go to 150 for it as i need to be rid of it soon but i pains me to do so as it is an excellent bike .
Did you purchase it brand new ? Or buy it used ? It was brought brand - new 2 years ago . I am somewhat interested in it , but was really planning more of the $ 100 range . Would you be willing to meet in the middle at at $ 115 ?
You can have it for $ 45 00 as is . I feel like that 's a steal already without me putting more work into it . Any chance at a warranty ? Not on this 16 year old beauty but I promise it 's in good condition . You can even test drive it .
I can understand that . So what is the least you 'll accept for it ? I 'd say I can knock $ 15 off if you can pick it up . I don 't really need matt resses so if I pick it up how about $ 145 ?

You said you 'd be willing to lower the price in the listing -- would you take 4 dollars ? I can 't go quite that low - sorry . How about $ 9 ? A little too high for me -- how about $ 6 ?
I think it is right around 3000 . It does not get as much use as it should . I had a baby 3 years ago and it has kinda been collecting dust ever since . Nice . Can you work with me on the price any ? I 've got about 1100 . Well I do have an offer for 1300 for tomorrow so if you could match that and pick it up today we have a deal .
Hello . How long have you had this bike ? I have had it for only a year . It is in great shape . Do you do better offers ?
I can 't do that . But based on the year your local credit union would issue you a small loan for the balance . It is new enough to still qualify for new car rates . True . I really want the car . If it has low mileage , a sun ro of and new tires , would you take 9000 ? If you come up to 9 500 we have a deal .
800 is very low for a unit like this . They go for 1600 but I am willing to go down to 1300 . That 's too much for me . I can do 900 . Is there a yard ? The unit comes with either a patio or a balcony . 900 is far too low for us to consider .
hello , are you open to offers ?
Oh sure ! I have 4 available . They are all in mint condition . They have a 15 " seat height and sit on 7 " chrome legs ! They are designer chairs . this chair rocks , it looks very comfort ible however i would be willing to make a purchase if i can get a good deal on it . They are super com fy ! Tell me what you are thinking for price .. I cannot go too low , they are worth a lot .
I am willing to let it go for $ 550 . This is a more than fair asking price . Are you willing to negotiate the price though ? what is your offer ?

Would you consider $ 100 ? That is a little steep how about 155 . I can have it in your hands tomorrow . Also I can give tips on setting up or for a nominal 15 dollar fee I can help you install . If you waive the fee , and help set it up for 155 we have a deal .
that is some what higher than I was a looking for .... what can you tell me about how it runs ? It 's in great condition . It 's only 6 years old and I 've upgraded a lot of the parts so it 's pretty customized now . It also has a great sound system . I can offer 900 cash and pick up today .
We do accept pets . only small pets and there is a one time fee of $ 300 . We have a no smoking policy . That 's good , ours is only a mini . Are there any utilities included in the monthly rent ? Utilities are separate but they should not run more than $ 75 a month . Our two bedroom is asking $ 14 87 a month .

Would you be willing to take $ 120 for it ? I mean it was used once , I 'd probably take 160 for it , because it cost me 250 originally . If I pay in cash and pick it up today , could you do $ 150 ?

HI !!! I have a vintage console for sale for $ 50 . 00 if you are interested ,. That is a cool console . Looks to be in good shape as well . How do the speakers sound ? I tested it and it is functional with no missing parts . I will be happy to demo it before cash exchanges .
$ 200 is a bit lower than I will accept due to the matt resses being brand new . Right now the lowest I will take is $ 250 . Yes . That is a good deal but I can 't do anymore that $ 225 . Okay , I 'm sorry I can 't go that low . Thanks for your interest .

I could give you $ 39 for it .
Th ats fair , are you willing to drop the price ? I can take 20 % off . That would bring the price to $ 160 , and we can deliver it to you . I can w iggle up to $ 100 and pick it up myself .

The paint is beautiful and if you 're willing to pay close to my asking price then I can offer a coupon from my friend who runs a local paint shop and you will be able to change the color if you would like to , how does that sound ? Well Im not sure on paying that much for a 43 year old vehicle . I am sure 61 k is not original I am sure from my expertise on cars that is rolled over so that makes the value drop . I can offer $ 24 50 and come now to get it . I 'm not sure if that will be approved but we can give it a shot unless you 're willing to increase your offer a bit ? Perhaps you could meet me 3000 which is still almost 2 k off and I can change the oils and other liquids for you too ?
Hi , I saw your ad and am interested in the item . However the price seems to pricey . Can we negotiate ? How much do you have in mind ?
Hi , are you interested in the car ?

Great , I see you are interested in my Samsung TV . Yes could you tell me any details about it ? it is 51 " Plasma TV , I ve had it for about 6 months Im sadd en by the fact that I have to sell it .
No , i think 7 200 is as high as I can go , since it is a 13 year old car . Sorry , I can 't go that low , Blue Book has it listed for $ 8 500 , so I am already $ 1000 lower that actual value . How many miles does it have ?

Yes it is . How much are you looking to spend on this ? Well , my wife isn 't currently working because we just had a child , so our budget is a bit reduced . However , we 'd still like to buy a home to have a little extra space for our expanded family . I was hoping I could get something for around $ 1500 . That sounds fair . How about 1800 ? Does that sound fair to you ?
Hello .
Yes it is , are you interested ? I am ! I see that you 're offering cash only in F ols om ... any chance you could go a little lower than your asking price if I came over in person , especially give the bike 's age ? Maybe 45 $ ? I know it 's a big ask . Yeah that 's quite a bit under my asking price . I could go $ 75 but it 's in really good condition and a cool bike to own .
Thank you for your interest . Any questions I can answer for you ? How long have you had it and are there any damages or scratches also is the shade very secure on the lamp ? It 's in almost perfect condition . Had it for a few months , but it just doesn 't fit anywhere in my space . F its perfectly together though . Makes it unique .
I 'm loving your phone . I wish it were a rose colored , but am interested . Only thing is I 'm on a strict budget and can afford about $ 130 . Would you be w iling to lower your price ?

I 'm asking for $ 100 for it . I don 't know it seems pretty old . Any chance of dropping it to $ 40 ? I want it , but not that bad .
Hi there , saw your ad for the entertainment center . It looks like it 's in good shape , how old is it ? It is in very good shape with only a couple of n icks on the top , as shown . It is about 2 years old . $ 250 seems a little high , I could get a brand new one for not much more . Would you take $ 180 ?
It is fabric . No stains , no smell . Never smoked in and no pets , so it is in very good quality . Nice . Well it 's a little over my budget and the way it is the book value is around $ 6000 . Since it 's clean and just what I 'm looking for I 'm willing to go higher . Can you do around $ 65 00 ? My lowest offer is 7000 .

Only a couple of years . But , they look brand new . Can I take them off your hands for $ 135 then ? H oe bout we do 140 and I deliver them to you myself ?
Sure . How much were you thinking ? I was hoping to pay like 250 but that 's pretty low , I think I could meet you at like 300 and pay in cash ? $ 300 would be great .
i have this beautiful item for 200 . Hello . What are the exceptions that would cause you to not consider this to be in excellent condition ? there are a few d ents to the ledge but not that bad .
Hello I have here a reduced price vehicle that might be perfect for you ! Which one ? This is a Dodge 35 00 4 x 4 with a welding rig . Also the vehicle is an automatic so I hope that will be okay ? We have put on new tires on the front and also new brakes and locks on the doors . How does that sounds ?
Hello . Thanks for viewing my listing of the home . Yes , I 'm interested in renting it . I have a very stable rent history and can provide references . We would be interested in moving in ASAP . What is the lowest monthly payment you would be willing to accept ? The lowest I could accept is $ 34 00 . Would that work for you ?

Hello .
Not brand new . But , they are in great working order . How much would you like to pay for them ? I would like to pay 7 . 7 dollars is a bit low . How about ten dollars ?
Yes I plan on it . What is the sq . ft . of this unit ? It is roughly 1100 sq ft , open concept . It 's a steal at $ 26 00 a month . I only have one . I don 't know . I 'm willing to pay $ 22 50 at the most for that size . I was a real tor fo 15 years .
will you deliver ? no , i can 't deliver it . it is too big for my car . I 'd like to offer 185 since I have to travel 60 miles to get it .
It is definitely close to UC , with quick access to BART . that is great . What will be the monthly payment ? 1850 .
Hello .
Well , I was hoping we could talk about the price . I can give you 3000 cash . I can come to get it right now . Cash sounds nice but that 's not nearly enough . This car is older but it has been well maintained . I can take $ 6000 . I don 't think I can do it for $ 6000 . How about 4 500 and you tint the windows before I buy ?
I lost my ear plugs from my  iph one and would love a new pair . I saw your ad but 5 dollars is a bit steep . Would you consider 2 dollars ? Considering that it is new and I am handling the shipping I would think $ 5 is a very good price . How much is the shipping ?

I see that the listing price is only $ 14 87 a month and I felt that was a little steep really .. This is a high quality apartment and high quality apartments don 't come cheap . I 'd be willing to go to 14 50 . Okay , I totally understand . I wouldn 't do 1500 though as the listing wasn 't even that much . I can do 1400 .
Hi ! I am very interested in your pet c amber a ! Cool , it 's in great shape . I only have a 35 budget but , I also have a bottle of whiskey I was just gifted for my birthday but ... I dont drink whiskey . Since it looks like you do , I was wondering if you would take 35 plus a brand new bottle of whiskey ? given the camera is in working condition .
I am the only owner . I would like to sell it for $ 800 . How does that price sound to you ? I was hoping closer to $ 600 . Is there any room to work ? Of course ! I want your son to have it and for you to get a great price on it . Since I want 800 and you want 600 , let 's meet in the middle at 700 . I 'll even include a bid red bow and brand new helmet for your son !
That sounds reasonable ! Ok , do you want to look at the house ? Sure , that would be great . I also made an offer for $ 2500 .
Great ! It is a beautiful set . Very solid and well maintained . Are there any scratches on the table and chairs ? No damage at all . And it come from a pet free and smoke free home .
Hello , I am very interesting in the dress er . How old is it ? The dress er is 10 years old , but in great condition . Would you like to buy ? Has is been rep ainted ?
I 'm sorry I already made the final offer . I need 6000 minimum because of all the add - ons purchased and the work from the accident . I thought you said it was a minor f ender b ender ? How much work was done on it from the accident . And what type of add - ons ? Like from the original purchase price , if I were to give it to you for 5 k , that 's the cost of a Y aris with no camera , g ps navigation , and the couple hundred dollars I sunk into getting the f ender b ender professionally fixed .
I am interested . Great , what questions do you have ? How many miles are on it ?
[3, 1, 3, 1, 8, 5, 3, 5]

-----------------------------

-----------------------------
Why are you getting rid of it now ? We are downs izing and selling what furniture we don 't need . What was the original purchase price ?
Okay . Price is a little flexible , but with all the equipment it is worth about the asking price . Any other questions ? Yes , the price is a little high for such an old truck with over 200 k miles . Would you accept an offer of $ 9 , 000 . No , I wouldn 't . Even with high miles , there 's still life in this truck . Low est I 'll go is 10 , 000 .
Ok , great ! They are great speakers . Brand new in box . Great ! I can offer you $ 349 and can pick up ASAP . Could we make it a dollar more and go $ 350 and I can bring them to you while I run err ands .
I 'm afraid I couldn 't just let it go for $ 1000 . Would you be willing to up your offer ? I am willing to meet you in the middle at $ 1100 and I can come and pick it up today . Okay , if you 're willing to show up with $ 1100 , I think we 'll be able to make a deal .
hello . Hi . How much for the current vehicle ?
Its really really good . The sound is very crisp and I assure you that you won 't regret the purchase 1 . Great ! I dont want to spend a lot though so would you consider 200 ? That 's too low for what you get . I can do $ 280 last .
we do offer swimming privileges with rent . Ok that all sounds really good . But for those amenities and the location , I 'm told the rent really should be closer to the $ 2000 range so I 'm wondering what I 'm missing that is making the rate so high even with the small $ 200 discount ... The rent in this location is comparable to other apartments in this neighborhood . We offer all appl k iances already built into the home as well as granite counter tops , walk in clos ets , oversized soaking tub s and a spacious area to live with ` 19 ft lo fts . We would be willing to accept 28 00 . 00 for the rent price .
I am sorry , but that offer is far lower than I can accept . this is a prime location so the best I can do is $ 1 , 500 . Based on the size of the apartment , I think that rice is very unreasonable . I recently saw a similar apartment for $ 900 . The max I can pay for this a par ment in $ 1000 . The amenities in this apartment are top notch , it was recently remod eled and has been well taken care of . Tell you what , I can do $ 13 50 , and I will throw in free monthly parking which is usually $ 50 a month .

can you come any lower ?  ican give a extra 10 $ additional discount . that would be nice . how about the shipping ?
Ok great , would you be willing to sell it for $ 400 if I came and picked it up today ? I need at least $ 430 . The most I can do is $ 420 . I 'm going to have to pay at le ast $ 50 -$ 60 to get somebody to repair the chips and marks .
Hey there are you interested in buying my 2004 Lex us RX 330 ? I am . Beautiful car . What 's the mileage ?
Hello .
* Night stand . Sorry for the typo . It is brand new , but it has slight damage to the top drawer , which requires a little effort when opening and closing . It is brand new otherwise . I was just going to ask about how well the draw ers worked ! Well , it is very beautiful but the top drawer is , of course , the one I would use most . So would you take $ 52 cash if I come and pick it up ? I can do $ 60 . It 's already well below retail price .
How much is the shipping ? I can ship USPS for a couple of dollars . If you pay the shipping , I will go to 3 . 50 tops . I understand they are new but I will be getting a new  iph one soon and it will come with a pair .
I was hoping closer to $ 600 . Is there any room to work ? Of course ! I want your son to have it and for you to get a great price on it . Since I want 800 and you want 600 , let 's meet in the middle at 700 . I 'll even include a bid red bow and brand new helmet for your son ! He 'll appreciate the bow . You throw in a new pair of tires with the helmet and ill do $ 700 .
How about 6000 dollars for it ? That seems fair to me . No that would be a huge price cut and you haven 't really offered any justification for such a price cut . Blue Book value of this car is right in line with what I have it listed for . Okay , how about 79 00 ?

Hello are you interested in the bike ? Yes I 'm interested in the security system ! $ 500 sounds like a good deal , let 's do it .
I could go up to $ 110 . 00 and pick it up so you would not have to pack and ship . My listing is 950 . I could do like 750 and add a basket so you can carry your stuff with you to your mother . The list price is for $ 150 . 00 on a o tt oman . This is what you are selling right ?
If you can come today . I can drop it down to $ 35 00 . That 's still to high for me . The highest I can go is $ 26 56 . How about $ 28 00 and I will cover the first month light bill .

I 'm not sure . Is it very sturdy and is the mattress included with it ? yes it comes with the mattress . It 's very sturdy ! It 's made out of plush material , and the house is smoke and pet free , so the sofa smells fine still . It 's in great condition . $ 150 for it . that sounds all good put the pattern is really throwing me off and I 'll need a slip cover in order to have it in my house so how about $ 75 for me to take if off your hands .
s ounds great . $ 685 . Sure , you can get a spacious studio for that price . So do we have deal ?
it is a good size for a lot of different rooms or uses . Plus much easier to transport . Would you take $ 350 ? I could do 450 , but that is about as low as I can go . I really hate to part with it .

Good morning . I am interested in your Phillips Sonic are you have available . Can you tell me about it ? It 's a great electric tooth brush , with technology included that lets it start off gentle and work up to a thorough , vigorous cleaning . Very nice . The listing says it is new . Can you tell me why you are selling it ?
As I mentioned I don 't know the tech y stuff , but I imagine you could google them to see . I 'm sorry ... You will not be able to find these for less than $ 15 each .

Well it 's in perfect working order so I 'd like to get $ 200 . I 've always kept it inside . My budget is tight but I would love to buy this bike for my grandson . Would you take 150 ? That 's just a little lower than what I was thinking , could you do $ 160 . I 'll even deliver it to you .
$ 250 seems a little high , I could get a brand new one for not much more . Would you take $ 180 ? The price I paid was quite a bit higher , and it comes with an extra glass door . I would take $ 220 , since it is in very good shape . How about $ 200 , and I 'll pick it up myself ?
I 'd be open to going down to $ 60 including the additional tire . I could pay $ 50 and pick up and load myself . How about $ 55 for help with loading the bikes ?
No , it 's in perfect condition . How old is it ? I just bought it a month ago . I haven 't even taken it out of the box ! But I found out I 'm getting transferred , so decided to sell it .
I 've had it for just under one year . So it truly is in good condition ? Yes .
Hello - Are you interested in the apartment I have available ? I am ! How would you describe the neighborhood ?

I did not run one because as a project car I have replaced most main components to date . I fully conve ret ed it to Type R . Cool ! I am looking to buy this car for no more than $ 75 00 .

I 'm not in need of the matt resses , and I was wondering if we could work on a deal that we can both agree on ? $ 290 is just way out of my range . If you pick it up and cash only I could drop it to $ 185 lowest as I am moving . It would help me as well .
its brand new . how about the price ? actual price price is 220 $ but i was selling it for 175 $ without any profit .
what a nice place to live i would really like to get it as low as possible . Hello , right now it 's going for $ 2200 . It ' worth every penny . Recently renovated . Close to People 's Park and Under hill F ie id l .

hm . let see here . 11 year old car , 150 K . I 'll tell you what I can go 2100 for this car . She 's my baby , so I 'm a little higher than that on price . She 's still got plenty of life left on her . How about I throw in my snow tires that I was going to sell separately , and we call it 3 200 ? that 's still way above my range . can you do 27 50 ? that 's the max i can go .
Would you take $ 80 if I came and picked them up myself ? Okay , I will accept $ 80 . Sounds great ! When would be a good time for me to pick them up ?

Thanks for selling the bike . I 'm very interested , but I can 't go that high . What price were you thinking ? Well , I like that the bearings and hubs have been taken care of , but as offered I was thinking something around $ 200 .
Great . Are you willing to lower the price on it ? I do not think I can afford over 8000 dollars for a car . I could probably negotiate on the price but not too much . Honda Acc ords retain their res ale value and this one is in good condition with few miles . How about 6000 dollars for it ? That seems fair to me .
Yes I have a few questions . Are utilities included in the rent ? and what 's the closest trans ist line to the building ? Utilities are included first 3 months . Its within walking distance of AC Transit lines . Ok great , well I 'm very interested in the place and need to find somewhere to live as ap but the $ 399 5 is a little too high for my budget . Could we possibly work out a deal if I sign a 2 year lease ?

Are the parts in working condition ? Yes all of the parts work perfectly it 's just been disabled . I am asking 60 for the phone , how does that sound to you ? I would like to go a bit lower 45 ?

It is an entry level racing bike and I am asking $ 800 that is neg ot iable . Hmm , I think that 's a little more than I 'm looking to pay right now ... I feel like I could probably get a new one for that price . I am looking more in the $ 300 price range . I could do $ 500 and deliver it to you . It has new tires and upgraded seat for comfort .
Yes , I have recently inspected it and will be taking it to the DMV soon to renew the tags . ok , will you do 35 00 after registration is done ? Sure , I can do $ 35 00 .
Yes , but I have some questions . Is it made of real wood ? It is , and it 's a little heavy when you 're transporting due to that . I think I can deal with transportation . How about $ 100 for it ?
The unit comes with either a patio or a balcony . 900 is far too low for us to consider . That is definitely a plus . The most I can do is 1100 . How about 1200 ?
Great , I could do a 2 Bed room w / all the amazing amenities for $ 1 , 500 . D ang .. I am forced to move away from my old place because I can 't afford it at 13 25 ... I was hoping to pay something more like 800 - 1000 . Is that at all possible ? $ 1 , 000 is a bit low , If you could make a one bedroom work I could do $ 1 , 200 w / one month free .

I cannot go that low . I still have the original box and all the parts . 55 ? I 'd step up to $ 40 if that would help you out at all , but I just can 't see going any higher on something that might brick on me the first time I try to use it . So , $ 40 , and I 'd be willing to come pick it up so you don 't have to mail it . Ok , $ 40 it is and you pick it up .
Which one ? This is a Dodge 35 00 4 x 4 with a welding rig . Also the vehicle is an automatic so I hope that will be okay ? We have put on new tires on the front and also new brakes and locks on the doors . How does that sounds ? What 's the price ?
I would love to come take a tour . I am just concerned that $ 2 , 300 might be a little too steep for me to afford right now . I am a landsc aper by trade .

We have a contract with our own landsc aping company . We can offer you $ 100 discount per month if you sign a 12 months lease , providing that your application is approved . I think you will be impressed with our property and all the amenities that we offer . That sounds reasonable . I will be willing to go for the $ 2 , 200 per month , with a 12 month lease .

They 're basically a set since I have no use for them . They both work great . I can negotiate but $ 6 is a bit low ... I could go $ 7 and throw in the charger because I don 't need that anymore either . Okay , that will work for me . Okay great , could you pick them up today ?
This is a beautiful apartment at a great location , could you do $ 1600 ?
I am interested in talking about your car . It 's a 2016 m az da . It 's a beautiful car . why are you selling it ? /.
yes we can sure come to the same price . how about 2400 ? Oh wow , thats a lot higher than I was expecting . I 'm willing to maintain the lawn , and do yard work around the outside of the house to maintain property values and keep the neighborhood happy . If I do that , would you consider something more in the ballpark of 1900 ? that is too low .
Oh darn , that 's sort of inconvenient . Could you come down on the price a little since I 'll have to travel to the laund rom at and pay for the coin machines ? I was thinking $ 15 50 . Yeah , that 'd be a little too low for us . We could do 2100 and throw in free internet . That 's just too high . I get internet on my phone so I don 't need that . It 's really difficult for me to get around due to a disability so the laundry being so far means I 'll have to take a cab + pay the laundry machines . I could do $ 1 , 700 but no more .
Oh wow , thats very nice . From the picture I see the outside is very nice and clean / sc ratch free . Is the interior nice and clean and fresh as well ? The inside is in great and clean condition as well ! Okay nice . What kind of price are you looking for here ? I was only trying to spend around 13 k .
Hi I saw your ad , I need a new couch for my back room , but your price seems a bit high . Can you do 600 and I 'll come and pick it up ? I 'd rather not go below $ 650 , but I could throw in a couple end tables I bought to use with it .
Do you still have the tri ke ? Yes I sure do . Okay how does it run ? Any problems with it ? and how old is it ?

OK . How about $ 650 ? I 'd pay more if it was higher than 1080 P . Make it $ 700 and you have a deal . If it was a Sony then I would but Panasonic is not the greatest brand . I 'll tell you what , I 'll give you $ 690 .
Se ems like a problem a property owner deals with . Cover my maid and laundry service and I 'll go up to $ 3000 . Sorry , but that 's a serious lose situation for me . the nature of pricing is that costs are always flowed to the consumer . I 'll be able to fill this resort - style am ene it ie home with rolling lawn s and parks , and boutique shops , with a ren ter if you find yourself unable to come to terms with the cost of living ... also , the sooner we come to an agreement , the more of these H ITS we can do per hour . 35 00 / mo final price . $ 32 50 , since you 're in a rush .
Yes it is . Great . How old is it ? I 'm not exact on the age but it is a really nice sofa . It is from smoke free , pet free house and the mattress is in good condition as well .
No , minimal wear being a 2009 but even the original wheels are still in great shape . Would you entertain an offer of 79 50 ? I could do $ 8 200 if you can pay cash and pick up within 48 hours .
Y up , and the title . I can offer you 5 200 cash . I need 6000 , is that in your price range ?
Sweet . Can I come and pick it up from you guys for $ 450 ? I can 't go that low but would you buy for $ 550 ? I can only go to $ 500 im afraid . I was originally trying to spend $ 275 . but for this high quality Ill go to $ 500 .
I can 't go that low , unfortunately . The tires alone are practically new , and were $ 700 new . I can drop it to $ 3 , 900 . Sweet . Okay . I can go as high as $ 22 50 . But that 's really all I can afford at this time . Or , if it helps , I can take the $ 2 , 250 as a deposit and hold for you for a month so you can come up with the rest of the money .

Okay , in that case I am offering a price of $ 3 123 considering that I have to take care of all utilities . I see your point but I can go down to 32 50 , you 'll live the place , it ' fully remod eled so it feels like a brand new home . Of course I 'll need to come take a look at the place first , but , I 'll take the offer of 32 50 . Deal .
Has the bike been used a lot ? no , it 's fairly new ! Okay , well 150 is out of my budget . Are you willing to go lower ?
The wood burning fireplace in the living room is lovely in the winter nights . So cozy to sit by and relax after a long day ! sounds very nice . I like the picture . Me and my husband are looking for a place and this seems to be the one . I see you are asking 33 00 . Would you be able to go lower \. I am willing to negotiate . Do you have any pets ?
Hi do you still have the blu - ray player ?
I 'm great . How are you ? I 'm doing just fine , thanks for asking . I 'm selling this great bike for $ 375 . Its high quality and has been custom painted . It is just too small for my build .
Yes , it is . It 's practically new . Only used a few times ! do you offer delivery . I could deliver for the asking $ 125 cash . Whenever works for you .
Hello . hi . Is this studio in a good area ?
I 'm not in need of the matt resses , and I was wondering if we could work on a deal that we can both agree on ? $ 290 is just way out of my range . If you pick it up and cash only I could drop it to $ 185 lowest as I am moving . It would help me as well . How about $ 155 and I can come pick it up right now ?

hello , are you interested in this apartment complex ?
Hi ! I 'm interested in your Pri us ! I see your ad says " had backup camera ." Does it no longer have one ?
It is a beautiful home . build in 2011 , so it 's very new . 3 Bed rooms . 2 . 5 baths . It 's in a great neighborhood . It is a must see . Does it o c me with a home warranty at all . We do all the repairs and maintenance as a part of the lease . You are responsible of keeping the landscape according to H OA guidelines .
Well , what I wrote in the add . It 's an antique in pretty good condition . Okay , I don 't have a vehicle to pick it up in . Could you deliver it to my place ? I can pay a little extra for that . What price were you thinking ? Im trying to pay like $ 400 or so . I can deliver , that 's not a problem . I 've already had an offer for $ 450 , though , and it 's only been up for a day . With delivery , I 'd like the price originally offered .
I 'm quite sure he won 't . I can 't go over $ 35 . That 's not even an amount you can get out of the ATM , what is that liquor store money . $ 40 baby , $ 40 , this thing hasn 't even been sat on . It 's a " collect able custom " chair , HA ! Re - uph oster it twice , I don 't care . $ 40 . Well I was told to only offer $ 25 and I 've went $ 10 over my allot ment . . . perhaps we are unable to negotiate . I will not do $ 40 as I see no incentive to do so .
It does have a few minor stain but nothing really noticeable . Plus the sheets will cover anything up . Ok well my current bed got inf ested with bed bugs so I 'm in dire need of a new mattress . If I offer you $ 15 can I come pick it up today ? Bed bugs are horrible but yeah I can accept $ 15 just to help you out . I know how bad bed bugs can be .
Ok . Are they very noticeable ? no at all . Would you take $ 184 for it considering the d ents ?
Hi are you interested in the bike ? Heck yes . Great I am asking $ 425 for it . It is in amazing shape , very well taken care of with a ton of custom parts . I have quite a bit more in it but really don 't need it anymore .

I can 't go to $ 1800 , but could you do $ 2200 ? This is a bit steep for my budget . How about something in the range of $ 2000 , Ill even come on one of the off season periods when bu is ness isn 't that great .

that pretty old but I am still interested . would you take $ 450 for it ? Sure I can do that ! great .
th ats too low for me . the studio is listed at 12 95 , i could maybe go a little lower to 1200 or so . I cannot pay more than $ 980 ! i cant go that low , can you do 1100 ?
Yes ! It is a great GPS that comes in the box and includes a carrying case , power cable , and lifetime traffic ! OK , Because it is old technology , I am only willing to pay $ 10 . Can you accept that ? I think $ 15 would be fair considering it still works perfectly . You never stop needing directions , and this thing will get you where you need to go !
I have 5 to 10 movies . The discs are fine , but I want to upgrade them to 4 k . OK . How about $ 650 ? I 'd pay more if it was higher than 1080 P . Make it $ 700 and you have a deal .
Hello .
How bout 200 and I will deliver it to you , so you can come up with more cash ? Does the bike have any rust ing , scratches , or anything at all this is less than ideal ? It is in great condition . No scratches or anything .
It is very close to Val Vista park ( within walking distance ), and will give you easy access to 680 and 580 . that 's great . And is it 4 bedroom house ? Yes , 4 bedroom , 2 bath .
It may not be the latest model but it 's in great working condition , well cared for and professionally stored it is in new condition in box . I 'm unable to go lower than $ 125 . Would you be able to deliver it to me ? I can arrange that , yes .

Hey so I have a great bed for sale , the condition it 's in is excellent . Cool . I was looking for a bunk bed set . So what is it made of ? And how old is it ?
I am willing to give you 3 months rent cash up front if you will accept 36 00 a month . That sounds like a pretty good deal . Would you also like to stop by and have a look at it first ? Of course when is a good time and date for you i am completely open ?
I really like the accord . Are you the only owner or did you buy it used ? I traded my Tacoma for it with my 2 nd cousin . His parents got him the Accord , mine got me the Tacoma , so we traded . It 's a great car ! Has it been in any accidents ? Any scratches or d ents ?
I can go up to 315 . D ang what if we call it 330 and I will throw in the extra 20 so I don 't get in trouble and then also I will give you some books on BM X stuff ? They teach you all types of neat things about riding and other things , are you interested ? Deal !
Will you accept $ 1800 . That 's much too low , sorry . This home is in a prime location and has many updates . What about cable is that included ?
Hey there , id love to buy your couch , what can you tell me about it ? What price are you looking for , and is it in really good condition , or very used ? Hello ! As king price is $ 700 . It is in excellent condition . It was in our finished basement and barely used .

Yes I am . the details are shown to the right do you have any questions . Do you know if there is a high crime rate near this area .
I 'm afraid not . Okay then how about $ 19 55 ? If you can sign a 2 year lease I 'll bring it down to 2050 .
Ok that all sounds really good . But for those amenities and the location , I 'm told the rent really should be closer to the $ 2000 range so I 'm wondering what I 'm missing that is making the rate so high even with the small $ 200 discount ... The rent in this location is comparable to other apartments in this neighborhood . We offer all appl k iances already built into the home as well as granite counter tops , walk in clos ets , oversized soaking tub s and a spacious area to live with ` 19 ft lo fts . We would be willing to accept 28 00 . 00 for the rent price . Well considering there are swimming privileges I think I could afford to go as high as $ 27 50 .
Hey , would you accept a price of 1975 ? The yard doesn 't look great so I would have to spend time on it to make it better . I could get some cheap labor and a days work to get that lawn looking sp iff y in no time . I could renegoti ate to 2400 plus a red one lawn . I would still have to wait a day more then I wanted to , could you drop to 22 50 ? It will work out for both of us , you sell sooner and I get the price I want .
Yes I am . Is it in good condition ? Bare ly used , we bought it for my daughter but it doesn 't fit her . Would you be willing to take $ 120 for it ?
It is in great condition other than a slightly sticky top drawer . That 's good . Is there any issues with having a bright lamp on top of it ? The surface is very reflective but I don 't see why a lamp would cause any problems . Are you ok paying 75 for this night stand ?
it is recommended for ages 4 to 8 . Could you sell it for $ 70 ? Well I really need to get $ 90 out of it but I could de ilver it that would help .
hi , are you interested in a new car ? I am very interested . Has the car ever had any damage ? no , check out the car fax report , its in good shape , no damage . this only has 60 k miles , so i 'm asking $ 65 00 .

Hi , I am good and you ? Im great . Are you interested in the bike trailer ? I am . Can you tell me how old this is ? What condition is it in ?
I 'm willing to negotiate . Great . Unlike most tenants who may party which can lead to damages . I am a solitary home body . I do not smoke , party or have parties . I also am a fan atical clean freak and I love maintaining the grounds . I also do not have an pets . I would be willing to keep the grounds imm ac ulate for a reduced rent rate . If you 're willing to keep the grounds imm ac ulate , I 'd be willing to go down to 28 00 dollars per month .
Is it a noisy neighborhood ? My husband has pts d and too much noise is not a good thing . Oh wow , sorry to hear that , but this is a nice and quiet neighborhood . He will love it ! Is it located near any airports or train tracks ? Anything else noisy like that ?
I could go as high 114 cash today . I 'll even pick it up . man u gotta up the price i need the cash right now . I 'm offering cash . Make a counter offer . 150 is too high .
Hi I am interested in your bike . Great , do you have any questions ?
Hello . Nice car . Thanks , I took good care of it . So what about the maintain ence history ? AN y thing I should know about ?
Well if it is still halfway decent , I would be able to pay $ 5 for it . the phone is still brand new can you afford $ 40 . I apologize , I meant to type $ 25 . Since it is brand new still but one crack only , I will try $ 35 ?

Yeah , but I 'm in a hurry . Its posted for $ 25 , if you can pay now , I 'll let it go for $ 23 . I can only offer $ 15 at this time . That s too low . I 'm assuming you aren 't just shopping for charg ers , how long can you go without your BlackBerry ?
sorry I typed 174 instead of 164 . $ 165 and you have a deal . okay .
Hi ! I 'm interested in your table . Will it hold a small fireplace ? Yes it will hold a small fireplace . The glass is tempered so it would be excellent for that purpose . I am prepared to offer $ 95 , assuming the chairs are in good condition .
Would you sell it for $ 3 , 000 ? 3 k is too low , I can come down to 4000 . How about 35 00 ?
HI . Hi are you interested in my security cameras . Yes I am , are they new or used ?
Hello , I think I could use your mid century modern piece if I refin ish it . What are you asking ? This would be a beautiful addition to any room ! I 'm asking $ 550 , but I 'd take $ 500 if you could pick it up today or tomorrow !
is this a hybrid car ? yes , it is a plug in hybrid . Great now that mileage , well I would like to get it off your hands and I would have to worry about any future maintain ce concerns so in consideration I would like to offer $ 95 00 .

oh i see , although it looks like a beautiful dining room set , $ 1000 seems awfully steep for a used set . ill give you $ 500 for it . I could go lower as you would have to pick it up . sure that wont be a problem , how low were you thinking you could go ?
its $ 280 total .. i could go $ 250 for them all , but you ll have to pick them up . H mmm how about 50 each so 200 . for $ 225 i will throw in a box of unused divid ers and folders .
are you interested in this item ? Yes . great . do you have any questions ?
Hi , are you interested in my car ?

Hello . Yes . How many miles are on the car ? 180 , 000 miles , but it still runs great ! Great . Any other problems I should know about ?
Yes , the chairs look lovely . They are a nice 1960 's era antique set . Have the chairs been rep ainted recently , were they ref inished professionally ?
The top surface has normal wear and the edges have a few d ents from being used . O uch , so it 's really nice but I 'm hoping you can come down to $ 300 . I think I could let it go for around $ 400 and I can deliver .

So you 're interested in the iPhone ? Yes , I 'm not sure is this the latest model .
Hi ! Are you interested in the night stand I 'm selling ?
Yes . Is it in good condition ? I would like a newer couch . It 's in great condition ! I have had it in storage for the past 18 months , but it has been covered to protect it from dust / d irt . Plus its from a smoke - free , pet - free home . I would like to pay a bit lower than you are asking . Is 400 dollars okay ?
The price is listed at $ 37 00 . Under stood , the value is wonderful and I think I would make a deal at $ 35 00 for a better deal if possible . I can definitely come down to $ 35 00 .
How many speeds does this bike have ? 12 speed . I don 't think I could come up with $ 700 right now . If I come by in a couple days I might have $ 650 .
Hi ! I am interested in the wing back chair . I would like to offer $ 20 . What are you insane ? My boyfriend is so gay , we never even used this thing , he bought it and treated it like a grandmother .
Hi . Sure . It 's in good condition . Works flaw lessly . Awesome , that is good to hear ... I know it is listed as $ 12 but I would like to offer $ 8 with me coming to pick it up from you instead to cut down on shipping costs . I don 't remember how much I paid for this , but I think it was around $ 70 . $ 8 is just a little too low . I would take $ 10 for it . Is that acceptable ?

Good morning ! I 'm interested in your fut on chair . Is it still available ? Yes ! Do you have any questions about my chair ? Any issues ? Tears , stains ?
That price is a bit too low for me . I think $ 10 , 000 would be a fair price . I couldn 't do $ 10 , 000 . I 'd be willing to drive to you and pick up the car , and I 'd offer $ 86 00 . Hmm . I can maybe do $ 9 000 .
Ok ... any scratches or d ents ? it has a few chips around the edges and some marks on top . the front view is great . it has a very nice vintage pat ina ! I like it a lot , but I am on a bit of a budget . Would you take 300 ?
It 's heavily scratched , but a little paint could fix that up . It has a tire gauge and is light . I can do $ 130 . I could give you $ 120 . How about we meet in the middle at $ 125 , and deal .
None at all it is in very good shape . are you willing to accept 54 ? well I would really like to get at le ast $ 56 out of it . Could you do that ?
I guess I can take $ 13 , but no cookies for you . Okay and what 's the price for the delivery ? That was only if I got the full price , you 'll have to pick it up .
I traded my Tacoma for it with my 2 nd cousin . His parents got him the Accord , mine got me the Tacoma , so we traded . It 's a great car ! Has it been in any accidents ? Any scratches or d ents ? I 've been away at school , no one has really used it except for my grandmother to go to church . All the info is in the Car F ax .

Hi is the apartment still available ?
our ad is actually the price for a 2 bedroom ! it is 9 79 . Oh I see , and how much is a 1 bedroom ? We only have 2 and 3 bedrooms available !

How much would you like to pay for the battery ? I 'd like to pay $ 7 for it . I can come and pick it up from your place if that makes it any better .
It is , and it 's a little heavy when you 're transporting due to that . I think I can deal with transportation . How about $ 100 for it ? 100 is way too low for this quality . I can go as low as 175 .

This would be a beautiful addition to any room ! I 'm asking $ 550 , but I 'd take $ 500 if you could pick it up today or tomorrow ! That 's a little too steep for me . In antique guides , this is coming in , in perfect condition , at $ 200 - 350 . Would you take $ 300 if I pick it up tonight ? Cash deal . A store - b ought piece of this style would range you $ 750 -$ 1000 . $ 350 and we have a deal ! $ 400 and I 'll deliver .
Sure . I purchased the chair 6 months ago . It 's still in great condition , clean and free from wear and tear . We have a pet and smoke - free home . Awesome . Is it overly big ? No . It fits easily under a regular computer desk and through door ways .
Do you still have the bike for sale ? Yes I do in fact . Does it have any issues , i want to buy it for my son so I need to make sure it is safe .
Hey how are you today ? I have some interest in the table set .
Yeah , it 's part of that new generation of smart watches . Perfect , but we want to off - load it because it doesn 't fit on my son 's hands . That 's too bad . I have done some research and these cost about 275 new . Sometimes when they are on sale they are 250 . Since this is a pre - owned item , I would like to pay less than retail . I am sure you can understand where I am coming from . I can bring you cash tonight if you 're willing to take $ 200 . 225 and you have a deal .
It 's going to cost me $ 10 for the tires alone . Ok , well I can 't do less than $ 45 , I had it for $ 60 . Alright $ 45 will work . Thanks .
How many draw ers does it have ? There is a top and bottom cabinet as well as a hidden drawer in the top part . Are you neg ot iable on the price ?
Ok not too bad I was looking for a little bit lower rent per month , do you by any chance have any specials going on ? I really need to be around $ 825 . If you are willing to come in and sign our 13 month lease today , I can waive your deposit . this would still keep rent at 9 79 but overall save you almost 1000 dollars . That is a pretty good deal . I would be willing to sign a 24 month lease if you could get it down to $ 900 .

wow that 's so low . I am selling it at 65 . It looks like it will need a lot of work , though . Yeah but 25 is not worth what you 're getting . We need to be on a middle ground here .
Nice apartments , can you tell me a about them ? I am on a tight budget .

Yes i can , say 10 % off . I can pay cash today . Would you take $ 15 . For which item ?

Hi , I 'm interested in your  iph one . Great ! It 's brand new factory sealed so it includes everything that normally comes ( charg er , ear b uds ). Would you like to make an offer ?
Wow . The parking charge gives you access to a one car garage , you can choose to park there or to use it for storage . Are you willing to negotiate any ? My price range stops at 1500 including parking .
Well you 'll be in a close proximity to most shopping centers , and the schools are in a decent range . Most of the children in the neighborhood take the school bus home , and it doesn 't seem to be an issue for them . Great , would you take $ 2500 a month ? Unfortunately thats a bit too steep for this specific model . We 'd be willing to go as low as $ 3 100 , and throw in your air conditioning and heating paid .
I see . Are you willing to lower price if I come and get it now ? possibly . what price were you thinking ? I was thinking 35 $.
I can let you have it for $ 35 since there is a small mis - print in the ad . What is the mis print ? Oh you didn 't catch that one ? It says it 's never been used . The item was used for about a week .

That seems like what I am looking for . I would be willing to offer you $ 75 dollars for the set ! No , I 'm sorry , I can 't go anywhere near that low . This is a high end set in excellent condition . I 'm only selling it because I wanted something that would seat 6 . That s fair , are you willing to drop the price ?
This is one of the best pictures you will find when it comes to TVs and Samsung is top of the line . Take it or leave it . the offer isn 't showing up for some reason , let 's give it a second to refresh .
Yes . I 'm not sure what " disabled " means . Can you clarify what 's wrong with it ? That just means that it can 't be react ivated on any cell phone plan . I see . In that case , would you be willing to take 30 dollars for it ?
Hey I 'm interested in your TV . How firm is the price ? It seems a bit steep for a used plasma TV .
hello . how long you 've had the airport ? Just purchased it , took it out of the box then decided I didn 't want it so it 's brand new .
I assembled the bike myself and it is in pristine condition . It has never been rid en since I am a little too tall for it . Oh i see when are you available to meet ? I am available M - F after 4 pm and all day Saturday and Sunday .
No , sorry , that 's too low . I can drop the price to $ 240 though . If we lower it to $ 230 I can assure you that I can pick it up quick . $ 240 is the lowest I can go . Can we agree on that deal ?

s ounds like a deal to me : - ). Awesome ! So then I will pay $ 60 plus the kids bike . Perfect and thanks ! OK .
That sounds great . Im guessing the interior is in good condition and no scratches ? How does $ 2000 sound ? It was actually my dad 's before he gave it to me and he took really good care of it , the interior is in really good condition for the age . I 'd say 7 / 10 if I had to grade it . Ok that sounds good . Would you take $ 2000 ?
That price is a bit high for me . Would you consider $ 200 cash ? If this was a gift from someone to you for Christmas , it is like getting free money and freeing up some space .... W ont find an unused one anywhere near this price anywhere . Can 't go lower than $ 300 . I 'm hosting a movie night with my friends and family and this would just push it over the top . My budget is literally $ 250 . Could we help each other here ?
Well , I might be . What condition is the car in ? It is in excellent condition . It has only been driven by me . It has never been in an accident . Okay , well if it 's such a great car , why are you trying to sell it ?
Hi there , I am interested but have a few questions . What questions do you have ? Are there any scratches or kn icks I SH OU DL BE AW ARE OF ?

HI , i 'm interested in your Civic . When did you get it ? I bought in in 2016 brand new .
Hi , I am very interested in this item , but the highest I can pay is $ 900 .
Good morning ! I 'm interested in your fut on chair . Is it still available ? Yes ! Do you have any questions about my chair ?
I can 't see it very well in the photo , the trees and bushes seem very over grown ... Don 't worry , I 'll take care of the yards for you . I 'll make sure they are cut before you got in . How about $ 2500 ? That is a very fair compromise . I could definitely do $ 2500 with the compromises you have made , thank you .
I am very interested in the television for sure . What condition is the television ? Condition is like new . I have only owned it for 6 months . Great the price is pretty high . Would you be willing to accept $ 840 I will pick it up myself and pay today ?
Hello . Hi . I would love to get rid of this bike soon . It is 800 and a great price , seeing that it cost much more when it was originally purchased . I 'm looking at getting this for my son for his birthday . Can you tell me if there is anything wrong with the bike ?
Would any type of services come with it ? there is a full bath , and kitchen with stove , in a great location . i can throw in gas ? Then I would like this for 1100 .
Same metal as the table . They are cush ioned and in perfect shape . that 's good . how would you like $ 50 for the set . I can pick it up to save you the delivery . I paid nearly $ 200 for it just a year ago . Best I can take is $ 100 .

I have to go purchase a new remote so this will be additional expense and time consuming . I will give you $ 60 . how about I throw in a d vd player and we meet at $ 75 . $ 70 and I can come get them now .
Could it go down to closer to $ 1800 ? I would really like to get at least $ 21 00 . It has so much stuff to offer ! Not to mention , a great view ! Is there any local attractions close by ?
Yes ! This beautiful unit is available for $ 2200 . It 's a great neighborhood , but that 's really a lot for a one bedroom . How many sq . feet ? It is 1 bedroom and runs about 700 square feet . The apartment is in a great location , close to everything social .
I 'm not exact on the age but it is a really nice sofa . It is from smoke free , pet free house and the mattress is in good condition as well . Thanks . I see you have it listed for $ 150 , but would you accept $ 135 ? I think that sounds like a pretty good offer . Sold for $ 135 ?
that is quite a low offer this bike is in great condition it is just a little to big for me . It 's a little too big for me as well . I am 5 ' 11 " and will use it lightly to get from point A to B . I don 't think $ 800 is enough for a 24 lb aluminum bike , especially one from 8 years ago . I understand your point I willing to take $ 700 for it .
I am interested in the tooth brush . How is the box ? Any damage ? The box is pretty damaged . If by " dam aged " you mean " signed by Tom Cruise " !!!! Wow , in that case I would have to have a lower price to take it off your hands . $ 20 ?
It is used so I wouldn 't be willing to pay what you are asking as that is retail . I would offer you $ 45 . It is only a month old and in new condition . I can offer an extended warranty if you 're concerned about it being a month old ... I just don 't think it is fair to ask retail for something that is used . I would offer you $ 45 .

I am willing to sell the 96 Lincoln for that price . But I 'm looking for closer to 8 , 500 for the truck . Well it does have a lot of miles on it , can we bring it down to 49 00 . It does , so I am willing to negotiate more . I can throw in the d ually bed with the truck , for $ 6000 .
Have the chairs been rep ainted recently , were they ref inished professionally ? Yes , I had the chairs professionally rep ur posed so that they would be restored to an excellent condition . How much are you asking for the set ?
Hi , are you interested in this one bedroom unit ? Yes , I am . am on a budget . Are you willing to negotiate on price ? As king price is $ 16 33 / month and does not include parking ( that is an additional $ 75 / month ). However , if you sign today I can bring the price down to $ 14 50 and waive the parking fee .
Great , it 's actually the spare we kept in the back room of our company that we only used like 5 times over 6 months we 've had it . Okay well I see this item selling for $ 50 new how about I give you $ 25 for it ? 40 , my boss only wants to sell it because we need to make another deal square .
Yes , i 'd like to offer 27 50 for it . That 's nearly 1000 below the listed offer . could you go 29 00 ?
Well it 's in excellent condition ! It was never abused by my kids . No cre aking or sque eking from the frame ! I 'm also throwing in a mattress . Hmm okay , seems like its in good quality and everything . Could you do $ 200 for it ? I can come pick it up in my truck . Hmm for $ 250 I can bring it to you .
That 's still a little low . I 've got a cover for it so you can keep it outside all year round . I 'll throw that in . How about $ 13 50 ? I could do 1 , 300 , but that 's already a month over overtime for me ! You sound like a hard worker . $ 13 25 and we 've got a deal .

Hello are you interested in the apartment ? I am , but I 'm unable to afford what you 're asking . Are you flexible on the price ?
Well Im not sure on paying that much for a 43 year old vehicle . I am sure 61 k is not original I am sure from my expertise on cars that is rolled over so that makes the value drop . I can offer $ 24 50 and come now to get it . I 'm not sure if that will be approved but we can give it a shot unless you 're willing to increase your offer a bit ? Perhaps you could meet me 3000 which is still almost 2 k off and I can change the oils and other liquids for you too ? Ok if you will update the fluids that I can pay $ 3000 see ya soon .
Thanks for that information . It puts my mind at ease . I 'm definitely interested in buying the bike today . How about 8 60 ? Since I want $ 930 ( price at $ 20 less so you can purchase new pedals ) and you want $ 860 , how about we meet directly in the middle at $ 8 95 ? 8 95 is a bit more than I wanted to spend and the bike is 10 years old . How about 8 80 cash and I 'll come pick it up today ?
This is a high quality apartment and high quality apartments don 't come cheap . I 'd be willing to go to 14 50 . Okay , I totally understand . I wouldn 't do 1500 though as the listing wasn 't even that much . I can do 1400 . How about we meet in the middle for 14 25 ?
Would you like to make an offer on the Back Pain solution ? how does it work . You apply it to your back and it relie ves tension and pressure . It uses Continuous Passive motion .

Would that be the new blue book value or used blue book value ? Used , it 's mostly because it 's a Lex us with all the amenities and add - ons . I figure it 's decent to give it for 7 500 because of the history of a f ender b ender . Do you have all of the service records for it ?

Hello .
Well I 'll be honest , my price range is about half of what you 're asking , but I certainly don 't mind paying a little more for a good quality product . right I understand , it is a super high quality product have no doubts . Would you be able to pay 2500 if I can also throw in a spare parts kit worth 500 - 600 and then also will add a set of tires and wheels to go with them ? That 's not unreasonable , but still a little high for me . Can you do 22 50 ?
I 'm asking $ 100 for the entire set . Will that price include delivery ? I could work that out if you want delivery .
I 've never smoked a single cigarette in my entire life , so I can safely say it 's smoke free . Nice , and good to know . The wear on this isn 't like gar ish scratches , just light disc ol oration - I think it makes it look a bit home ly , personally .
I see you have a 98 Cumm ins for sale , can you sell it for 2500 , because it 's so old . I am willing to sell the 96 Lincoln for that price . But I 'm looking for closer to 8 , 500 for the truck . Well it does have a lot of miles on it , can we bring it down to 49 00 .
They are available . How much are they ? They are $ 10 . One is new and one is used .
So i have a BE AUT IF UL apartment available it has all utilities AND internet INCLUD ED in the 1500 dollar price . It is in a premium area and is only a 7 minute walk to the BART station so you can get anywhere ! I can tell by the photo that the apartment is in good shape , however I think that 1500 for that area is a little steep . Would you be willing to negotiate the price with me ? I can go a little lower does 12 50 suit you a little better ?
how about the n ie gh bor hood ? is it safe ? is it near a bank , school pharmacy , bus station ? It is a great Neighborhood that has all the basic social amenities . We can book an appointment for me to go show you the place but we need to agree on a price so we know if it will be worth the time . I understand , I am willing to offer you $ 17 05 without a deposit , because we are settling the price and I haven Â´ t even seen it .

Absolutely , that was an issue with the previous tenant , so we decided to change up how we rent . Awesome , how about the neighborhood and schools what are they like ? Well you 'll be in a close proximity to most shopping centers , and the schools are in a decent range . Most of the children in the neighborhood take the school bus home , and it doesn 't seem to be an issue for them .
Hi . Thank you for selling these apartments . They look really great ! Yes ! They are great with easy access to shopping and dining . I see that they 're listed for $ 9 79 . That 's close to my range , but it 's looking like it may be a bit out of my range .
what is your offer ? I can offer you $ 495 for it . h mmm , I can go down to $ 540 and throw in delivery .
about 6 months ago . Does it have insurance on it ? I does still have factory warranty .
I have a mirrored night stand with some slight damage . It tells me you are selling it for $ 75 ? well I bung led this . I wanted $ 75 , but I thought better of it with the damage . You must pick up , though .
Could you come down on the price at all my budget is around $ 100 what can you do for me ? In all honesty , I have it listed here for $ 250 so the lowest I 'm willing to go down to is $ 190 . Well it doesn 't seem like you are willing to negotiate very much and that price will not work for me I 'm sorry .
Hi ! Is the Theater Speaker Package still available ? Yes it is . Anything I can help with ? Has it ever been used ?
I can w iggle up to $ 100 and pick it up myself . I 'm sorry , no . $ 140 is as low as I 'm willing to go . I have a few others interested in the set . Can you bud ge a little bit more ? I am on a strict budget ! $ 125 and we got a deal !!!

Ut ilities are separate but they should not run more than $ 75 a month . Our two bedroom is asking $ 14 87 a month . That 's a little more than we 're looking to pay . Could you include utilities in the price at all ? Especially if we have that pet fee . If you can pay $ 14 87 I will include utilities .
Ut ilities are not included , but I can give you a small discount in rent if that will help . How does $ 27 00 sound instead ? What about trash service ? Yes , trash service is included by the county .
Yes I am is it in a quiet neighborhood . Yes it is no noise and very calm . Are there any restaurants or shopping near by maybe even walking or biking id st ance .
Really ? The previous ad is for a 2012 for $ 3000 and it has all the same features plus lists new brakes and tires . Also , according to Blue Book it is only wor h 1500 . toy ota 's and h ond as don 't go by k bb . they last forever . and this car was maintained meticulously . that previous ad might have a salvage title . this is a clean title . no d ings , no defects of any kind . and all power . it has 150 , 000 miles on it . Even if it was maintained perfectly that 's a lot of miles . I only need a starter car for my kid so this would be a good one if the price was right . I can go up to 17 50 but that 's near the limit .
Hi , thanks for your interest . Can I ask you a few things ? I know you gave alot of information in the post but I didnt see how old the set was . I am not sure exactly how old the set is but I 've had it for over 20 years and we had purchased it second hand . My guess is as old as 30 years ... each piece is in great condition .
There are pics in the info , I will gladly send you those if you dont see them . I 'm asking for $ 290 for it cash only . its in excellent condition , no bumps or scratches . Is there anyway you could take lower than that ? I just don 't have that much right now . Okay , I can go down to $ 200 for it , cash only , and you pick it up from my place . I can 't go any lower I 'm afraid .
HI ! How are you ? I see you have a single speed b ian chi for sale .
Is it in great condition ? I want something that is very durable . It 's very solid , and it 'll make you very solid . It 's a great chest . Okay . I will offer 70 dollars for it . Is that okay with you ?

What was the original purchase price ? The original price was $ 1200 . I think my price of $ 290 . is fair considering it still looks like new . I will buy it cash for 200 and pick it up tonight .
hello .
The highest I can go is $ 3000 . I 'm not in a hurry to sell it , we put a lot into it . Semi t ints all the way around , wired for audio , extra r ims . $ 3 200 . Ok $ 3 200 is fair .
Th ats too high for me . I can offer 14 000 today cash . I can 't go that low , how about 16 000 ? I can do 15 000 and throw in a free fridge that is like new that I was going to sell .

HI ! I 'm interested in your batteries ! What kind of phone do they go in ? They would work for any Nokia or phone compat ile with Nokia batteries . That 's great ! Would you take $ 6 for them ?
Hello , thanks for your interest . It 's a very nice table / night stand . It 's very sturdy and there is nothing wrong with the legs . However , there is a little wear and tear . I see it says something about a drawer pull . Is there a drawer ? If so , how large ? Yes there is drawer near the top , it 's kind of small . It will probably fit your little things like a small book and glasses .
How does 20 sound ? I think it sounds too low . How about 27 and you pay for shipping ?
Ok . Does it have any other flaws ? No that 's about it . I am taking it out at $ 75 and its reasonable considering what you 're getting . Ok .. I could come pick up today and have $ 67 cash in hand right now .
That 's nearly 1000 below the listed offer . could you go 29 00 ? It would have to be above 3000 otherwise I won 't be able to do it .

hi there !
Yes how long have you had it . Is there wear and tear . It 's pretty new I 've only had it for like a year and it 's been kept in a room no one really uses . No signs of wear and tear . Could I give you 250 for it . I would like to add it to my room as it matches my dec ore .
Yes , but first I was wondering if there is a warranty with it ? I think there should be .. It 's straight from Apple . I received it as a gift at Christmas and it 's never been activated so there should still be a warranty ? Oh I see . Would you take $ 685 for it ? I have cash and can pick it up within the next hour .
It is a beautiful home and nice neighborhood . I can 't see it very well in the photo , the trees and bushes seem very over grown ... Don 't worry , I 'll take care of the yards for you . I 'll make sure they are cut before you got in . How about $ 2500 ?
Hello .
Hey so I have a great bed for sale , the condition it 's in is excellent . Cool . I was looking for a bunk bed set . So what is it made of ? And how old is it ? It 's made of pure wal nut wood , only a couple of years old . The kids wanted separate beds now they fight too much .
Yes , I definitely am ! I was wondering if you could go al itle lower in the price , maybe 10 500 ? Hmm , I am a bit flexible on the price , but this truck is in near mint condition . What price were you thinking of ?
Custom for yourself , aw , will you miss it ? Well 27 is the highest I can go . I will miss it , but to be honest , it needs to be in a home that will appreciate it and ride it . I just don 't do that anymore . I can do $ 35 and I will meet you at The BART new Richmond . Ah , I should introduce you to my kid , he loves bikes . Give it to me for 30 .

Not at all . Its old that 's why the price is 120 . Would you consider $ 60 ? that 's half of what I am actually asking . Sorry can 't go so low . Its a very unique piece and its an old ie so definitely the amount doesn 't justify that . I can accept $ 100 .

Good afternoon , you are interested in the charger ? Yes I am . Would you consider 20 for it ? I would consider 20 , but I would deliver it to you for the full 25 $.
How large is this item ? its spacious . Ok ... any scratches or d ents ?
Oh my ! Well , I am a single mother and my child could really use this . Would you be willing to come down on the price considering you got a brand new replacement for your used one ? actually I had pulled out the old one to sell and was going to ask $ 100 for that one so that is why I am asking that for this one . But how much were you thinking ? How would you sell the old one if it was run over by the neighbor ?
It 's only $ 20 off your list price though dude . Would you be able to do like $ 50 or $ 55 if I paid you the other 5 or 10 in a week ? i really need these chairs man . $ 20 off would be 59 . 99 not 45 , and I can do $ 15 off and do $ 65 each , final offer . dude fine I can do that , but just so you know you listed the price at $ 65 yourself , so ur not even giving me a deal . $ 15 off what you 're asking for would be $ 40 ... but whatever I was scam min you anyways I have $ 65 in my wallet . LOL .
i am asking 29 00 for large living in spacious area . yea its close to Metro which is noisy because of public transit . i would like to see if you can do bet tr on the price . i can offer you a deal of 2500 for the best comfort in your life .
Would you take $ 210 for it ? It 's barely used . If you can get it by the weekend I could sell it for $ 250 . Ok I can do $ 250 and I can get it this evening if that is ok ? Say 6 - 7 .
Hi there . I 'm interested in the chair . Would you be willing to sell it to me for $ 50 ? I think 65 is a pretty fair price because it 's in really good condition and they are very high quality . I can go down to 60 . Would that work for you ?
Yes I would . Would you accept $ 15 . 00 ? I can accept $ 20 for it if you come to my house and pick it up . Would that work for you ? If I have to come pick it up , how does $ 17 . 00 sound ?

hi , I am interested in your bike ! Alright , I hate to go all meta here , but I 've attempted this crap like a dozen times and people keep quitting on me because they don 't know how to h agg le , and the only time it went smoothly the chat got auto - re jected anyway .

Hi . I see you interested in my studio ? Yes I am is it in a quiet neighborhood . Yes it is no noise and very calm .
I 'm very interested in the pointer . I 'll give you 18 for it , and I 'll come and pick it up . Great . I 'm afraid I need a little more for it than that . How about 30 ?
i cant go that low , can you do 1100 ? Would any type of services come with it ? there is a full bath , and kitchen with stove , in a great location . i can throw in gas ?
Oh great ! So there 's 1 bedroom , is laundry included ? Not on the site but there is a couple of them within a few blocks . Oh darn , that 's sort of inconvenient . Could you come down on the price a little since I 'll have to travel to the laund rom at and pay for the coin machines ? I was thinking $ 15 50 .
Absolutely , we can arrange that tonight if you 'd like . It has very few miles on it and a Car F ax report is available . Great . Are you willing to lower the price on it ? I do not think I can afford over 8000 dollars for a car . I could probably negotiate on the price but not too much . Honda Acc ords retain their res ale value and this one is in good condition with few miles .
The apartment is gorgeous . How is the neighborhood ? The neighborhood is great . Is there a pool at the complex ?

I was thinking about $ 21 00 . You should come by and take a look . We are generally available from 8 : 30 to 1 . I could show it to you in the evening as well .
I 'm interested in the matt res if it 's still for sale ,.

How heavy is the item ? The item is probably only about 30 pounds not nearly as heavy as it looks . Can it be del ieve red or will I have to pick up ?
hi there , i see you are interested in my space . I am very in et erest ed . But I was wondering if there was anything wrong with this ?
Great ! Is it in good condition ? It is in great condition . It is hardly used . I think 700 dollars might be a little too steep of a price for this couch . Could you possibly lower the price down to 500 ?
well the case by itself is probably worth $ 25 so can you do $ 45 ? I could do $ 40 and pick it up today . i will take 40 .
Hey there , we have a nice condo here , you 're interested ? i am extremely interested ! but the price is just a bit too steep . I am still leasing my current apartment and am paying rent there as well , but i would love to move in as soon as possible . Is it possible that we can lower the price to $ 119 7 ? If so , i could absolutely give a down payment as soon as this negotiation is over !
Th ats great , it is in excellent condition . I know it says near mint condition ! So are there any scratches on it or d ents ? No scratches or d ents . It looks practically brand new .
Can you tell me how many miles are on it ? I am interested . I notice you say had backup camera . Does it work ? That sounds reasonable for a 2007 . Would you be willing to accept a lower offer ? Say 35 00 ?
Ok , cool . What type of interior is it , fabric or leather ? It is fabric . No stains , no smell . Never smoked in and no pets , so it is in very good quality . Nice . Well it 's a little over my budget and the way it is the book value is around $ 6000 . Since it 's clean and just what I 'm looking for I 'm willing to go higher . Can you do around $ 65 00 ?

Ok can you tell me a little bit about the car ? Did you do any off ride driving with it ? No , this car is too beautiful to drive off road .

Would you be willing to let her go for 12 000 ?
Hello . Is the sofa bed still available ?
None of the 2 bedrooms are that low , are you willing to pay 1800 ? wow that is still a bit much . Is there anyway if I sign a 2 year lease you could come down to 1400 ? I could manage that . Sorry but I don 't think we will be able to make a deal if you aren 't willing to pay at least 1800 . I can offer additional things but you will need to afford that as minimum ?

22 80 but I can go higher if there are special amenities . There are many amenities . The location is right next to a freeway and there is a shopping mall next door . The home features a was her and dry er as well as being pet friendly . Ok sounds good . Would you accept an offer of 22 80 ?
It is about 17 inches wide and 5 inches high . I have never purchased an item of this nature before . Would you be willing to come down in price to $ 85 ? I could do 95 and deliver it to you this item is pretty much new never really used it .
What questions do you have ? Are there any scratches or kn icks I SH OU DL BE AW ARE OF ? There is one small scratch that happened the last time I moved .
There are a couple of d ings around the edges and it has a new screen with a screen protector . So it has been dropped a few times ? No , its just normal wear and tear . Never dropped .
Will it support a apple laptop ? Oh definitely , both with wifi and c abled capabilities . I 'll throw in the cables if you want , $ 65 and we 're square ? Sounds like a good deal , How much has it been used ? Is there any scratches or damage to it ?
Yes , still have it for sale . Good , I am interested . I see it has a lot of perks and you are asking $ 425 , but that is a bit over my budget . Will you take $ 297 for it ? Sorry , $ 297 doesn 't cover the parts added and bike .
I know they are used , that 's why I 'm only asking 1000 when it cost nearly $ 3000 to import them , they are very sturdy . Sorry , I still can 't pay that much . The most I can pay is $ 750 for a used dining set . If you can come up with $ 850 I might be able to arrange for a neighbor of mine to use his truck , but I 'll need to pay him .

Hello .
Hello , are you interested in my cabinets ? Yes ! Is there any damage to the cabinets ? Nope , we are liquid ating our business since my grandma died .
It looks pretty cool but I see that it has a bit of wear . How would you feel about accepting $ 50 for it ? Well , that 's proof that it 's done its job ! We could do $ 75 , I could throw in a good scrub down , the Warriors flag , and even deliver it for you . : - ). $ 75 sounds good and if you have a k idd ie helmet to keep my kid 's n og gin safe that would be good .
Are utilities included ? I 'm afraid not . Okay then how about $ 19 55 ?
nice bike you got there . Thanks its for sale if you 're interested : ). I see that . it 's perfect for my 14 year old girl who is around 5 ' 4 . tell you what ? I 'll give you 500 ? That 's really a top limit for me on these things .
I could deliver for the asking $ 125 cash . Whenever works for you . would you consider coming down some ? Like maybe 115 with delivery ? Hey , that seems reasonable . I don 't mind that at all . $ 115 it is !
Could $ 14 00 work ? I 'm afraid not . Prices for 1 BR in this area are pretty standard . I was considering the price reduction due to your specific circumstances and laundry criteria . But that price would be too low for a 1 BR in this area . Are you sure 1500 isn 't work able ? I already am at my max and 1400 .
Good morning . I am interested in your Phillips Sonic are you have available . Can you tell me about it ?

Hi are you interested in these chairs ?
Great condition . All maintenance has been up to date and just passed SM OG check . Super clean inside and out and clear car title . Awesome . I see you have it priced at 57 00 . I 'm a college student and definitely in need of it . Could you possibly do with 47 00 ? I could do $ 4 , 950 ..
How much would you like to pay for the battery ?
I am interested in your car . What is the best offer you have received ?
That 's great ! It 's an excellent car and in great condition . I 'm asking $ 4 , 400 . My family and I have gotten a lot of use out of it over the years . I 'm only selling since two of the kids have gone on to college so I don 't need such a big vehicle anymore . It has over 100 , 000 miles on it I would like to offer 4000 . I think $ 4000 is fair . I can do that . Thanks !
it 's a steal at 35 00 bucks . you won 't see this deal again .
I can offer you $ 50 for it and come get it today . It is in really good condition I am asking $ 100 but willing to negotiate for the right price . I was thinking around $ 85 . I have to go purchase a new remote so this will be additional expense and time consuming . I will give you $ 60 .
I can go down to $ 175 . I was thinking closer to 150 would be more fair ... How about $ 160 ?

Im great . Are you interested in the bike trailer ? I am . Can you tell me how old this is ? What condition is it in ? Funny story actually .

Hi . How much for the current vehicle ? 6 500 .
This is a nicely sized home with 2 , 285 square feet . It has 4 bedrooms 2 bathrooms and a nice 2 car garage . Everything is nicely maintained . How long is the lease for ? One year .
There are 180 k miles on it . Can you tell me how many miles are on it ? I am interested . I notice you say had backup camera . Does it work ?
Yes it is still available . How many square feet is it and what is the deposit ? It is 1200 square feet and the deposit is $ 1 , 500 .
45 00 is a bit steep for a 2004 model , I would be more interested at a price point near $ 2000 . Sorry I can 't go that low . I would consider coming down to $ 4000 but no lower . 135 K miles is a lot , even with a new transmission there are probably parts going bad that I will have to deal with $ 2500 and I will pick it up and take care of the title transfer .
Hi ! I am interested in buying this complex out ! Or renting ! Can you give me some details ? Sure 4 bed / 1 bath in Emer y ville .

Hi there . Is this available ?
right I understand , it is a super high quality product have no doubts . Would you be able to pay 2500 if I can also throw in a spare parts kit worth 500 - 600 and then also will add a set of tires and wheels to go with them ? That 's not unreasonable , but still a little high for me . Can you do 22 50 ? I can but will have to keep the wheels and tires but we could do that , do you want the offer ?
Hi I am looking for a fixture for my hall way ceiling . Can you tell me the size of this ? 21 " D iameter by 4 . 5 " high . I think that would work . I love the color and it would go perfect with my paint color . I would like to offer you 25 .

That 's great ! The price seems a little steep though . Would you be willing to ac ce p 2 200 ? This car only has 130 k miles so it 's low mileage and runs great ! no major mechanical problems . I can understand that . How about 3000 ?
Hey there !
Yes it is , it 's $ 120 . Ok how bad are the d ings and scratches on the legs ? You have to really be looking to see them . Bare ly visible .
What is the brand ? The mattress 's are Se aly Post ure ped ic . I think the beds brand name is Ashley furniture . What year was it purchased ?
Only two chairs ?! That means I will have to buy two more . Can you do 140 , I can come now . OK , I was thinking about keeping two of the chairs , but you can have all four chairs and the table for $ 170 . 160 and you have a deal .
hi .
Yes it does . Does it have any scratches ? It has a couple of tiny d ings but only when you look at it very closely .
The apartment sounds nice , but I really need a place with a was her / dry er and a dish washer . I work a lot and don 't have time to get everything done on my own . We have a laundry facility on site for your convenience , and if you would like i can have a dish washer installed for you . I think if we can get a dish washer in there , I would be comfortable paying $ 11 50 in rent .

The phone is in great condition , and I feel that it is worth more than that . Okay , what do you feel it 's worth then ? Since it has no scratches , and is still in fantastic condition , I think it is worth more like $ 130 .
I 'm loving your phone . I wish it were a rose colored , but am interested . Only thing is I 'm on a strict budget and can afford about $ 130 . Would you be w iling to lower your price ? It is a great phone ! I completely understand being on a strict budget , but I can 't go that low . The lowest I can take at the moment is $ 270 . Oh man ....

Hello . Thanks for viewing the listing . Hi , I was wondering if you could take $ 80 . I am buying for a nursing home and can 't afford much .
Hello , I 'm fine thank you . I 'm interested in your Rose wood dining table , chairs and corner cabinet . Great ! It is a beautiful set . Very solid and well maintained . Are there any scratches on the table and chairs ?
it is an a 16 62 , the screen is perfect if you needed to use that for a replacement or any other parts . Ok well I am looking to spend only $ 35 since it 's a phone that can 't be used other than for parts . well the case by itself is probably worth $ 25 so can you do $ 45 ?
L ol okay . What kind of offer are you wanting to make ? Well , given it 's a 1080 p and they go $ 400 new . I 'll pay $ 350 . That 's way less than what I was hoping to get . It 's in mint condition . I can throw in delivery if you can go higher on it .
I would like to pay 210 dollars for it . Could that work for you ? That is a bit on the low side of what I was looking for . I do have new ink cartridges that fit this printer that I can include if you are closer to my asking price . Okay , then how about 260 ? That would be better for you I bet .
Okay then how about $ 19 55 ? If you can sign a 2 year lease I 'll bring it down to 2050 . That won 't work . I will only be in the area for a year .

Hi how many miles are on the vehicle ?
I have a limited budget and not a lot of time ... I wanted to make an offer of 850 . I understand - I am ready to work with you on this . As you know , this is a quality bike and well worth the asking price , however there is some room for negotiation . so what do you think of 850 .
Sweet . Okay . I can go as high as $ 22 50 . But that 's really all I can afford at this time . I will need to have some work done on it , it sounds like . Maybe an electrical problem somewhere . Its for my daughter , she 's going to college next month . How old are the tires ? I can 't go that low , unfortunately . The tires alone are practically new , and were $ 700 new . I can drop it to $ 3 , 900 .
I see it 's an older model though . A co ording to the state documents it was built in the 1920 's . How much are you asking for ? I am asking for $ 18 95 . It was build in the 1920 's but fully renovated and remod eled . Safety inspections have been done . It 's in a great area and a great place to live . $ 18 95 is pretty steep for a studio . i can do $ 17 00 and give you first , last and security .
nice place you got here . does it have a parking space ? Hello there , how are you today ? Yes we do have one parking space available . i 'm great . and the park ign space helps . this is a bit over my price range . what if I sign a 1 year lease , what 's my rent then ?
Hello , i am very interested in one of your apartments but i would like to negotiate the price . Okay well we can talk about this for sure : ). The highest i can do right now with my budget is $ 10 40 .
Okay , Will you deliver or must I pick up ? I can deliver if you 're willing to pay full price of $ 600 . Will that work for you ? I will need to pick up then , I do not have $ 600 at the moment . I can do $ 550 .
Any issues ? Tears , stains ? Nope , none at all . It 's in excellent condition . I am a bit lazy and used it to mostly just hang clean , dry laundry . H aha ... I do the same thing with my treadmill . I see you 're asking $ 100 . Would you accept $ 90 if I came and picked it up ?

Wow , this looks great !
Well , I 'm not interested in a cd player with blu etooth , I 'm trying to find something that will get me from point A to point B . How about this 27 50 and I 'll pay for the transfer of title along with coming and picking it up . Tell you what . Make it 3000 out the door and you 've got yourself a deal . Okay , $ 3000 it is buddy . That 's a deal !
What 's the mileage ? Are you the original owner ? does it have a clean title ?
I don 't know . I 'm willing to pay $ 22 50 at the most for that size . I was a real tor fo 15 years . Well , if you are willing to pay $ 24 00 I 'll include the security activation and monitoring . $ 23 75 and Its a deal with the one year monitoring . Plus I can pay the entire lease at once .
no need , I believe you , ok so I can offer you 40 dollars . that 's way too low . as i said , it 's new out the box . the least I 'll accept is 55 only because I want to get rid of it as ap . I will accept 55 if you deliver it to me , sounds fair ?
That is definitely a plus . The most I can do is 1100 . How about 1200 ? 11 50 and it 's a deal .
It 's made of pure wal nut wood , only a couple of years old . The kids wanted separate beds now they fight too much . I can understand that . So what is the least you 'll accept for it ? I 'd say I can knock $ 15 off if you can pick it up .
That 's too much for me . I can do 900 . Is there a yard ? The unit comes with either a patio or a balcony . 900 is far too low for us to consider . That is definitely a plus . The most I can do is 1100 .

Very it is beautiful ! Are you the original owner ? I am . I have recently washed it and it is pet hair free and from a smoke free home . How long have you had this ?
Thanks its great . Are you interested ? Yes I am , is it very old ? Does it have anything wrong with it ? Not at all . Its old that 's why the price is 120 .
I have a p ug are pets allowed ? Yes but I can 't waive the deposit fee if you have pets . Ok I see that you are asking for $ 22 95 i was budget ing for somewhere around $ 16 06 .
No , this car is too beautiful to drive off road . There 's not even a scratch on the paint , thanks to the matte black wrap . Yeah the black wrap looks pretty sweet to be honest . Well I really want to buy the car from you . Would you be willing to let her go for 12 000 ? I have student loans to pay off , and $ 12 , 000 will not allow me to pay them off . This car has top - of - the - line amenities , how about $ 18 , 000 ?

Good morning !
My end is showing that I listed it for $ 250 . We can work on the price though . Okay does it come with anything and how long have you had it ? I 've had it for about a year and I have a few smaller accessories to throw in with it : cup holder , bell , lock , new set of tubes .
I can do a 2 year lease if you need . Hmm yeah that still leaves me with the same problem since the kids will be in school longer than 2 years . I could save up for a better place in the same school district if the price was a bit lower . Ye a , thats up to you . I 'm looking for 37 00 , but I would be willing to willing with you .

Not quite . I 'd love to buy it , I really need a place . But I can only afford $ 2000 , would that work ? I still have to pay for mo vers and everything , so I really need to save some cash here . I could perhaps give a little w iggle room in this price , If you re signing the 12 month lease , I could do say $ 2200 ? That would definitely work , but only for $ 2000 im afraid . Hopefully you can make this work . it would mean a lot !

Hello . Thanks for viewing the listing .
That 's not unreasonable , but still a little high for me . Can you do 22 50 ? I can but will have to keep the wheels and tires but we could do that , do you want the offer ? Fair enough , I don 't mean to low ball you . With the spare parts and extra wheels and tires , I can do 2500 .
No . It is in great condition and does not have any bugs , or mold . still 700 is a bit pricey . i can do 400 for this seeing as how it 's 7 years old . It is old , but I promise you that it is a quality couch . How bout I lower it to 500 and I deliver it to you myself ?
174 . 174 ? I could do that . sorry I typed 174 instead of 164 .
$ 2 , 500 is what I was thinking . Would you meet me at $ 2 , 700 ? Well , I can 't find any other faults other than I am a cheap person .. So , I su pose we can do $ 2 , 700 .
Hi is this car still available ? Yes , I just listed it , you are my first reply . Great . It says no pets , but what about children . They are worse than pets !

Hello .
Hello , I wanted to know id the patio set is still available ?
Hey there , I see you have n okia batteries . I 'd love to buy em ! They are available . How much are they ?
Would that be $ 200 off for just the first year and then the rate would go up by $ 200 or more the next year ? No , the 200 would stay for the length of your lease and then would go up or stay the same based upon rental rates once you re up your lease . we are also offering 1 / 2 off security deposit at this time . Hmm ok . I notice it says " Hard wood - style " floor ing , that means it is lam inate right ?

We 're a tall family ! The cabinet is made from rich mah og any . Oh , lovely . And there aren 't any scratches on the wood ? Draw ers function correctly ? No scratches , just one ring on the top of the cabinet . All doors work great and the secret drawer functions perfectly .
Nice antique bureau you have their . How much are you asking for ?
Hello , I seen your rug posted and I am very int rest ed in it . Are there any noticeable signs of wear ? Not too bad . It is a bit fur led at the edges .
it 's 3 years old . got it in 2014 . If I could pick it up ton ite by 6 pm ( only 2 hours away ) and get it off your hands would you accept $ 10 . 00 ? That way you are over and done with one bulky item to move . i want at least 50 percent of the original price which is 12 . 50 , but i would be fine with 12 . i really want this off my back like you said , does that work for you ?
Does this car come with a warranty . If you are interested in a warranty , I can provide one . Would that be an additional feel ; all I have to offer is about $ 58 50 .
Would you mind lowering the price a bit ? I was hoping to pay 24 dollars for it . The price is already pretty low but I can do 30 . 30 will work for me . Can I pick it up today too ?
This seems like a place I am looking for . I can offer $ 18 50 . This apartment has also been recently renovated and is in a very desirable location . Would you be willing to bump it up to $ 2000 , with 50 % off your first month ? How about $ 1950 ?
Oh ok . That makes more sense . Seems like you have a studio also . Tell you what , I could do the three bedroom for 2000 , or two bedroom 1800 . I 'll sign a 1 year lease either way . I can let you get the 3 bedroom for 2100 but that is as low as I can go . Yeah , that 's a big out of my range for me . You could probably do the 2 bedroom for 1800 , though ?

Hello . I saw your ad about the bike . What are you looking for for it ? It is an entry level racing bike and I am asking $ 800 that is neg ot iable .
It is from 2009 . That is pretty old . I am thinking for price closer to $ 480 ? It is old but it is still a great bike . I 'd like at least 600 .
Can we meet at $ 50 and we have a deal ? It 's going to cost me $ 10 for the tires alone . Ok , well I can 't do less than $ 45 , I had it for $ 60 .
Ok . That might be a problem . Because of the defect I am willing to pay $ 50 . How does that price sound to you ? That 's fair . For a few dollars extra , I 'll deliver them to your home personally . That 's around $ 60 . Ok 60 is perfect !
Hey there do you still have the truck ? Yes , I still do . Can I answer any questions you may have ? How many miles does it have ? How often has it been used off road ?
In cluded in the price is a designated parking spot feet from your front door and a visitor lot nearby . That sounds nice . How recently was the property renovated ? You 'll be the first tenant in since the renovation .
Cool . I was looking for a bunk bed set . So what is it made of ? And how old is it ? It 's made of pure wal nut wood , only a couple of years old . The kids wanted separate beds now they fight too much . I can understand that . So what is the least you 'll accept for it ?
Great . Our 1 bedrooms go for $ 24 00 . They seem nice , but that seems kind of high , I was thinking around $ 1200 . I am unable to go half . My bottom line is $ 1800 . The amenities and location truly cannot be beat . Our facility is modern and close to everything in town .

Hello I am selling my prized possession . I call her Razor because she is sharp . I am selling her for $ 20 , 000 . She is reliable and runs perfectly . Everything like new . No accidents . I think $ 20 , 000 is out of the question for a 10 year old car . She does look nice indeed however the new model costs not much more . Can you come down more to around $ 6 , 000 ? $ 6000 is way too low and the only reason why I am selling her is because I have some loans that I have to pay off . I can give it for $ 18 000 .
I think my n anny is smuggling cocaine , this item could help me .

Hey so I have a great bed for sale , the condition it 's in is excellent .
The price is 115 00 which was already reduced . Also there is more too there are many high dollar tools involved with the sale if you like . I have for you a diesel machine , dual oxygen bottle rack , st inger missile case as a tool box , I also have a Pac rat tool box too and some small ers tools would you like details about the smaller tools ? I really like it , but the price is too much ! I see maybe there is a compromise . If you only want the truck without any of the tools then I can let it go for 8 500 or something like that ?
Good evening , hope you are well . Are you interested in the Entertainment set ? Yes , I am very interested . It seems like it is in good condition . Would you be willing to negotiate a price with me ? I will need someone to help me move this , so I may have to pay them as well . It is in very good condition , very solid , and will last for many , many years . I will sell it to you for $ 200 , and arrange for a couple of my stronger friends to deliver this to you , if that is acceptable to you .
OK , Is the I OS up to date ? It has I OS 10 . 3 . 2 . Would you be willing to sell for 200 ?
Cool . Do you allow pets ? Yes pets are allowed , the backyard would be great for a dog ! Wonderful . Is the 37 00 firm ?
Yeah , that 'd be a little too low for us . We could do 2100 and throw in free internet . That 's just too high . I get internet on my phone so I don 't need that . It 's really difficult for me to get around due to a disability so the laundry being so far means I 'll have to take a cab + pay the laundry machines . I could do $ 1 , 700 but no more . I understand , I am myself disabled and I know how tough it is to find affordable housing . How about this . We will cover your utilities if you can do 2000 .
only 20 k miles on it . It 's in excellent condition inside and outside . M aint ained well with little use . Wow I really want this but my budget is not quite there . Do you have any room on the price ? I would be able to buy it today if I can get the price down . I 'm selling it to try and pay off student loans , so im afraid I can 't go any lower than $ 15 000 , its in really good condition , it would be a steal even at $ 15 000 so no way I can go lower .

What is your asking price for the BMW ? There isn 't one listed on the ad .
Hello , do you still have the charg ers available ?
Do you still have the bike for sale ?
hi , you interested in the bike ? Hi , yes I 'd be willing to offer $ 85 . it 's slightly lower than what i can do ... it 's an Adam ... it 's fold - able and i can throw warriors flags too ... how about 92 .
$ 149 , cash , and pick up today , if possible . Sounds good ! I can pick her up today , but in return I need a discount please ! How much are you thinking ?
Hi ! I 'm interested in the apartment you have listed . Can you tell me what you 're asking for it ?
of course . what is your budget like ? I 've been looking for a car ranging from 2 . 5 K to 4 K . I am looking at a few other cars too . Would 3 K work for you ? I will need 5000 to part ways with this one . But what we can do is that i can get 1000 down from you and the rest can be paid monthly .

yes I sure can . If I pay in cash would you accept $ 140 for the bike ? I can do $ 165 since I will be delivering .
Sure . It measures 2 . 8 by 6 , the picture does not do th ia rug justice . Its gorgeous ! I can see that . how old is it ? what is the condition ? Its around 40 year a old , it came from my Grand mas house . Considering the age its in really good shape .
Hello . Has this item been used previously ? It has seen some use in its day , but as I 've stated , it has been well cared for and kept up in the original box . 165 is out of my budget . Would you accept 130 for it ?
That 's too low for me , unfortunately . Low est I can do is $ 36 00 . is it inspected . Yes , I have recently inspected it and will be taking it to the DMV soon to renew the tags .
Nice , okay . It 's hard to tell from the picture is it an extended cab ? Yes . Overs ized ex very thing and many extras . When you can you pick it up ? Cash only . I can pick up today but there is a withdrawal limit at my bank so I can pay you in cash today but only for $ 8 , 000 .
Not a case , but it does have the screen protector . I can also go down to 150 so you can get a case with that money . That would definitely help so I don 't have to pay the full price , because I 'll definitely need to get a case . Great ! Deal ! 150 ?
You only put 75 , 000 miles on a 13 year old vehicle ? Must not have used it much . Yes , it wasn 't used much at all . It 's going for 13 000 . I like the off - road tires , and it looks awesome but 13 000 is a little high . I was hoping that you could let it go for 7000 . It 's still 13 years old .
If you are interested in a warranty , I can provide one . Would that be an additional feel ; all I have to offer is about $ 58 50 . no additional fee for the warranty but I would need to get close to my asking price with the warranty . I would be willing to accept $ 63 00 .

We have in unit was her dry er connections but not included in this price . We have parks and lawn s to have a picnic with ing walking distance . Okay , well I was looking for a price around $ 18 97 , but it can be negotiated . Are you running any move - in specials right now ? We are having an August move in special . The first is free ! So your first month rent wouldn 't be due until September . We also have another option of 2 year contract and we give you 1 floating month with no rent . You chose the month you want free with a voucher .
That is a very big discount . I will add free delivery , maintenance for three months and a final price of $ 750 . That 's not a very big price drop . What about $ 600 ? The lowest I will go is $ 700 and no other perks .
Yes , that is correct ! Could it go down to closer to $ 1800 ? I would really like to get at least $ 21 00 . It has so much stuff to offer ! Not to mention , a great view !
I am very interested but I would like to offer $ 250 since it is not new . I have cash in hand and can pick up today . i can 't let it go that cheap i paid much more than 400 i can deal with 300 . I will take it for $ 300 ! Please accept my final agreement to the right .
I 'm sorry , that is too low for a rental in this area . 2500 is my final offer . Would you consider $ 21 00 . No , sorry . $ 2500 is as low as I can go .
Will that be cash ? yes . If you come get it today with the cash I can give it to you for $ 45 .
Yeah and there is a very nice 2 car garage and awesome school district ! The price and area is good enough that I would be willing to go for $ 27 00 due to the perks . The price is listed at $ 37 00 .
Can you tell me the amenities ? We have a laundry room , picnic table , b b q in the common grounds and parking spaces . What is the deposit ?

Hello . It 's 10 years old . Excellent . Based on the condition and age , it 's a little higher than I 'm looking to pay . Would you accept $ 14 for it ? I can 't go as low as $ 14 , but could you do $ 18 ?
good evening i like the car you have . Hello . I am glad it caught your attention : ). I can come pick it up from you , but Saturn is no longer in business so servicing of it can get difficult , id like to pay 1200 for it .
It looks beautiful . I would love this for my bedroom . I am willing to let it go for $ 550 . This is a more than fair asking price . Are you willing to negotiate the price though ?
How does $ 35 sound ? I 'm a little short on cash ! I was thinking 45 but i can go 40 . If I bring a friend to help move it and vacuum where we move it from , would $ 38 be ok ?
Is the couch still in good condition and where was it stored ? It 's been in my storage for the past 18 months . It 's in good condition and was only used for 6 months . Well it sounds like you would really like to get rid of the couch so what do you take $ 300 for it ?
Great . I would love to have it . But the price is holding me back . Is there a room for negotiation ? What would you be able to offer ? My budget is $ 560 .
That all sounds pretty good , would you be willing to negotiate on the price , I can pick it up in person if that helps ... I 'm asking $ 250 for the bike , and pick up would be ideal . H mmm the list price says 200 , and I was hoping to get it for less than that ...
Great . I would like to come pick them up . Would you take $ 17 00 cash ? Would you go to $ 1800 if I threw in a table for the set ? I would do $ 17 50 with the table ?

Hi there , are you interested in the bike ? Yes I am . What condition is the bike in ? excellent condition , barely used at all .
Hi , this is a 3 bedroom , 2 bath house for rent .
Oh . That 's great ! I have $ 200 and I can pick them up today . I would be happy to take them off your hands . $ 200 is a bit lower than I will accept due to the matt resses being brand new . Right now the lowest I will take is $ 250 . Yes . That is a good deal but I can 't do anymore that $ 225 .
If you 're willing to come up a little I can throw in some extra things , what price did you have in mind ? Well I 'll be honest , my price range is about half of what you 're asking , but I certainly don 't mind paying a little more for a good quality product . right I understand , it is a super high quality product have no doubts . Would you be able to pay 2500 if I can also throw in a spare parts kit worth 500 - 600 and then also will add a set of tires and wheels to go with them ?
Well I want someone else 's kid to enjoy this bike too . So I 'll throw in his tire infl ator we bought , and our old bike lock , all for 90 . That 's a good deal . Will you deliver it ? Sure thing . We 'll swap info .
Yes I meant I bought it brand new in 2001 and it has been a good car for me for 16 years . I hardly drove it except to work twice a week and doctor 's appointments . Oh , I got it . Has it been in any accidents ? No accidents . It has a clean Car fax .
I think we can include parking with the rent price . The overall price is neg ot iable as well . Well the place is fairly bare , I 'd like to offer $ 1200 , which is under but I 'd be willing to pay a 1 month security deposit as long as it 's refund able . That does sound like a good deal . I can accept $ 1200 .
It has been re - painted 5 years ago . what about any current scratches ? There are no scratches . Are you willing to pay the $ 550 for them ?

A couple of chairs and a table are already provided , you can reference the photo shown to see what they look like . Okay . Well , I am very interested , but my budget only allows me to spend $ 14 56 . Is there any way I can have it at that price if I take it today and pay you cash ?

Hello , what do you think of my home ?
I have looked at listings and you have quite a lot of competitors for less monthly . Your home is closest to my job which is why I am so interested . I plan to live in the area for at least 3 years so I was wondering what the monthly rate would be for a 36 month lease ? The list price says its for 12 month lease . The last I can give you is $ 1600 . okay , great ! I will come down today to sign the lease !
Is there any scratches or stains on these ?

Hi , i 'm interested in your sound bar . It is a great sound bar . Do you have any questions about it ?
Can you tell me anything more about the bike that will convince me of that ? All I see is a 2009 aluminum frame , the cr anks et , and the handle bars and stem . It has Shim ano Dev ore XT cr anks et , R itchie 's Comp handle bars and stem , Av id Ju icy 7 Hydro lic Disc Bra kes . These are all high end components . Ah , I didn 't know about the brakes ! That makes a big difference for me . I 'm willing to pay $ 650 , in cash if you 'd prefer , and pick it up myself .
Hello . I 'm interested in buying the car . How many miles are on it ? The Pri us currently has 180 , 000 miles but the car has been very well maintained over the years . Sounds good . Would you be willing to accept $ 31 50 for the car ?
Hi are you interested in my security cameras . Yes I am , are they new or used ? These are some really high quality cameras that are only slightly used and in new condition . Also they are in the original box .
Well it would just be my wife and me . It will be nice to have the guest room too . We have no pets . Everything else about it sounds great , except that we have to commute to the city for work . We were thinking something more along the $ 2500 - 28 00 range for a suburban home . If you contract to stay in the home for a year we could bring the rent to $ 28 00 a month . That seems reasonable enough . The guest room won 't be used often except when our parents come from out of town . They aren 't messy but your price sounds fair enough .
Would you happen to know if it has working cartridges or if I have to get new ones ? Yes it does . Actually i just bought 2 new ink cartridges . One already installed in the printer and one as spare . These are complimentary to the sale . Wow that is great . Would you be willing to do $ 150 .

So would you take $ 52 cash if I come and pick it up ?

That 's really a top limit for me on these things . Wo ah that 's like 300 dollars less right away . That 's a big loss for me ! I can 't go that low .
I 'm sorry but that is too low . Thank you for your interest . I can do 50 dollars and an area rug that I paid 50 for . I 'm sorry I do not except trades .
That 's still out of my budget . I could go as high as $ 1 . 200 and it does seem like the perfect bike . I 'd hate to miss out . That 's still a little low . I 've got a cover for it so you can keep it outside all year round . I 'll throw that in . How about $ 13 50 ? I could do 1 , 300 , but that 's already a month over overtime for me !

I apologize as I can 't go to $ 7 000 . Could you do $ 10000 ? Its from 2004 and to get it up to emission standards is going to be a pain . If you can get to standard and throw in some hub caps , I can do $ 95 00 . I understand . $ 97 00 and you have a deal .
I love your cabinets ! Can you tell me something about them like how old they are and what is the cond it io in ?

Hello .
Hi do you still have the blu - ray player ? Yes I still have it and it works great ! Only $ 20 !
No . They are in excellent condition . Also , the covers can be removed and washed or easily replaced at Ike a . Good to know . They are a bit over my budget . There are very similar ones for sale for $ 20 but these look a little better . Can you do $ 30 total ? These chairs are worth 79 . 99 each . 30 for both is way too low for me . I could maybe do $ 50 .
Hi do you still have the I phone ?
This is a 21 speed . It is difficult to see from the one picture - does this have disc brakes ? It has Av id Ju icy 7 Hydra ulic Disc Bra kes .
Oh really that is great , more than what I expected . Does it currently have a case that may come with it ? Not a case , but it does have the screen protector . I can also go down to 150 so you can get a case with that money . That would definitely help so I don 't have to pay the full price , because I 'll definitely need to get a case .
Yes I am . Would you consider 20 for it ? I would consider 20 , but I would deliver it to you for the full 25 $. I could come pick it up if that 's ok . If you can sell it to me for 20 , I will be more than happy to come get it as soon as possible .
I 'm interested in it and I would like to offer $ 35 . I 'm not trying to be a low - ball er , I 'm just on a tight budget . And yes , I like wine and whiskey ! Is there any way you could go up a bit or maybe throw in a bottle of wine or something ? $ 35 is a bit low . Well , since I can 't see the item , how about I come up and check it out and if I deem it sound enough , i 'll pay $ 40 ? How does that sound ?

Are there any amenities like a swimming pool or clubhouse ? we do offer swimming privileges with rent . Ok that all sounds really good . But for those amenities and the location , I 'm told the rent really should be closer to the $ 2000 range so I 'm wondering what I 'm missing that is making the rate so high even with the small $ 200 discount ...
Based on the size of the apartment , I think that rice is very unreasonable . I recently saw a similar apartment for $ 900 . The max I can pay for this a par ment in $ 1000 . The amenities in this apartment are top notch , it was recently remod eled and has been well taken care of . Tell you what , I can do $ 13 50 , and I will throw in free monthly parking which is usually $ 50 a month . If you can do it for 12 50 , we have a deal .
there is a 1 month security deposit . Would you be willing to accept half a month security deposit the first month and half the second month ? Sure .
What style of furniture do you have ? I have several different styles of furniture in my home and this seems to go well with all of it . how about $ 250 and I will pick it up ? I can fit it in some place . Ok I think that is fair , It has a lot of storage space but does not take up too much room , it is a beautiful old antique chest , I think you will love it !
H m ok .. so would you still take $ 50 for it ? Since it 's slightly damaged ? I would like to receive at least 60 for it . My listing price was 75 ! and this is a really nice night stand . It goes for around 200 originally ! I will give you $ 60 for it .
Have they been used or checked to see if they 're in working order ? i checked every thing . it works fine and sound was amazing . How about $ 70 ? Would you do $ 70 ?
Great ! Do you accept pets ? We accept cats and small dogs . Awesome ! What is the going monthly rate ?

Sounds good . Can I come by and take a look at it ? sure . Are you willing to lower the price at all ?
Hi is the dining table and chairs still av ai able ? Yes they are . Are you interested in buying them ? I sure am . The photo looks great . What 's the condition of the set ?
I am interested in the Bike trailer . I don 't have quite enough money for your asking price , but can you accept $ 60 ? I 'm really set on $ 80 . Anything you might want to include that I may rese ll . I have a used kids bike that I can give you plus the $ 60 . The bike should be worth at least $ 30 .
It is about 3 years old . Okay . that 's not too bad . But since it will need some work I am willing to offer you $ 30 . What do you say ? Well I have already taken quite a bit off what it is worth in consideration of the work it will need . If you are willing to come get it right away I can guess I could let you have it for $ 55 because as I said I am rather firm on the price .
Ok , do you need a deposit too ? No deposit . What would you like to offer ? How about sign a 2 year contract that for the first year will be 1400 $ and the second year you can raise it up to 2000 $. I found a new job in the area and I will be more financial stable after the first year .
Hmm for $ 250 I can bring it to you . Oh wow okay , that works out splendid then ! Thanks a lot ! A Happy $ 250 !
O oh , I like the sound of that . Yard work is a pain . How about $ 2000 , and I 'll sign a 2 year lease . Anything more than that is really out of my price range . That is a little low , I have many people that are interested in the rental . But if you are willing to sign a 2 year lease , I can do $ 3 200 per month . I 'm neat , don 't throw wild parties , non - sm oker , and no pets . I might be able to swing 23 00 , but that 's as high as I can go .
it is available . It 's the table and 2 chairs . is the paint ch ipped ? No , it 's a year old and hasn 't been used because it 's bigger than I expected it to be . It 's been in storage . no chip or scr at ce hs .

Hello .
hello !
hello . s 3 gear . nice . i see you listed it at 275 ,. thats a bit high for a used s 3 .
Yes but the price is a little high . well 35 is fair market value , these are brand new , in sealed retail packaging . How does 20 sound ?
It is old but it is still a great bike . I 'd like at least 600 . Could you deliver it ? I could certainly do that .
Hello . I love this mirrored night stand . Does it have three draw ers ?
How old are they ? Only a couple of years . But , they look brand new . Can I take them off your hands for $ 135 then ?
Good thank you . So i have a BE AUT IF UL apartment available it has all utilities AND internet INCLUD ED in the 1500 dollar price . It is in a premium area and is only a 7 minute walk to the BART station so you can get anywhere ! I can tell by the photo that the apartment is in good shape , however I think that 1500 for that area is a little steep . Would you be willing to negotiate the price with me ?

Aside from what 's in the post , I 'm also going to cover lawn maintenance and utilities . I 'm only asking $ 25 99 for all of that . Well , are there any problems with the property ? Nope . It 's only 6 years old and I used it mostly as a vacation home so it didn 't get much use . I 've decided to rent it out since I don 't use it anymore .
I love this dining table ! Are there any scratches or loose bolts ?
Hello ! Do you have any specific questions about the listing ? I 'm here to help . Yes just a few . So does the $ 24 00 list price include utilities ? and I see that video surveillance is included , can you tell me a little about that ? Sure thing ! The $ 24 00 . 00 does include all utilities . The video surveillance can turned off and on at the resident 's consent but we like to offer our residents peace of mind with the surveillance feature .
Great ! Can you go lower ? I have a budget around $ 1800 . I am willing to negotiate , but I could not go lower than $ 29 80 . Wow .. That is still too high . How about 2500 ?
Oh so the three bedroom is the same price great . Well it is a bit out of my price range does it include any utilities or anything ? I should have said that some of the 2 bedrooms are this price but generally it is the price range for the 3 bedrooms . All utilities are included with all apartments and there are some other extras too ! I was really hoping to stay closer to 1000 do you by any chance have any specials going on right now ?
Yeah , $ 3000 . Way too low ! 35 00 ?
Hi , I 'm interested in your  iph one . Great ! It 's brand new factory sealed so it includes everything that normally comes ( charg er , ear b uds ). Would you like to make an offer ? Yes , but first I was wondering if there is a warranty with it ?
I see you are interested in the chest I have for sale . possibly but I am not completely sure if it would go with my kitchen or dining room furniture .

Thank you for clarification of the condition of the chair but my budget is pretty tight however I could go $ 25 if that would be acceptable ?

I am ! Unfortunately I 'm more in the budget for a space priced around $ 647 . Have I mentioned that this amazing apartment comes with parking , and is within walking distance to BART ? The view isn 't much and it does have a lot of Sec 8 people but is fairly priced for it 's size and location . I 'll bottom line it for ya . I need the lease and am willing to cover your moving expenses and knock $ 300 off the monthly lease price . That sounds like a great deal . I think I could swing $ 995 provided I get the part in an upcoming live animation sim psons film I 've audition ed for .
Considering that it is new and I am handling the shipping I would think $ 5 is a very good price . How much is the shipping ? I can ship USPS for a couple of dollars .
Hello . Are you interested in my phone ? I 'd like to offer you $ 94 for it .
hi there , i see you are interested in my space .
I am prepared to offer $ 95 , assuming the chairs are in good condition . The chairs are in excellent condition but 95 . 00 is pretty low . How about 120 ? $ 105 , and you deliver it .
Oh awesome , if I was able to come by this afternoon with cash would you be willing to take 1100 for it ? I was think more $ 1200 ? Ye a I saw that is your listing price but I was hoping you would be willing to negotiate ?
Thanks for your interest .
I 've had it for about a year and I have a few smaller accessories to throw in with it : cup holder , bell , lock , new set of tubes . Could you come down on the price at all my budget is around $ 100 what can you do for me ? In all honesty , I have it listed here for $ 250 so the lowest I 'm willing to go down to is $ 190 .

Good afternoon , you are interested in the charger ?
How close to 1000 would you take ? Hello . Wow , right to it . My kind of negotiation . I 'd be happy at 1200 . Lower than that I 'd feel cheated . It 's a really good bike . Do you have any questions ? How long have you had it ? Any wre cks or any damage to the bike ?
Is there anything wrong with it ? nothing wrong at all pretty much new . Okay . I see that you are listing it at 300 . However , I can buy a new one for that . Honestly , without any sort of warranty available and the fact that it is used - I can do 150 .
no , check out the car fax report , its in good shape , no damage . this only has 60 k miles , so i 'm asking $ 65 00 . I will be upfront with you . My budget is $ 32 50 , do you have any w iggle room on the price of $ 65 00 ? I can definitely work with you on the price , why don 't you come out and have a look at the car . if you are willing to do a deal for cash , i 'd be willing to go down to $ 59 00 .
Hello , are the bar st ools still available ?
Wow , this looks great ! There are some great schools in the area if you have kids . Really ? Do you know where they are ranked ?
Hello . Are you interested in this dress er ? I am ! Are there any stains or spots on the top ? Yes there are some chips around edges and some marks on the top surface . Its used so some of it is there .
I understand , are you willing to negotiate the price ? Sure . Make me an offer - more than 25 though . The best offer I could give would be $ 30 .

It is $ 33 95 . It 's in a small , 9 unit building . Okay I will definitely have to swoop in on that ! Seems like a real good opportunity ! Thanks a lot for the help buying this place . I 'm sorry . that was $ 399 5 .
I 'm offering cash . Make a counter offer . 150 is too high . i can go down to $ 135 if you pick it up . Meet me in the middle . How 's 120 sound ?
That sounds great . I travel for work so that is very important . Are the tires new or will I need to replace them shortly if I purchase the car ? its a 2016 . The tires are spectacular ! Its only got 8 k miles on engine , so there is a ton of tread left for you to coast through the sunset with . You 're also getting key less entry in this model as well as ALL leather interior . It doesn 't get better than that . Would you consider taking $ 19 000 for the car so some funds are left over for taxes and registration ?
nice . I am wondering if you would accept $ 21 , if I pick it up with cash . If you can pick it up tonight I can lower it to $ 25 but since it is new I really can 't take too much off . Which color were you interested in ? I think red or any color doesn 't much matter to me .
hi ther lets make this deal .
yes I am very interested in your desk , does it have any scratches ? Nothing deep into the wood , it is a used item but a little wood polish and elbow grease and it will look new . That 's great to hear , do you know what kind of wood it is made of ?
Do the batteries have a lot of use on them ? No , they have never been used . The item is brand new in sealed packaging . Will you take $ 25 ?
Yes we are just 5 miles from there . We have beautiful walk ways to that lead out toward the city center . Oh , 5 miles is too far to walk for my job . Is it a g ated community ? Yes it is a g ated community and dogs and cats are allowed . But there is a bus that runs every day that is free for residents .

Hello . I 'm interested in the bike . Would you accept $ 25 ?
Hi . I see your interested in my home ?
I see it 's listed at $ 25 51 a month . Do you have any move - in specials ? Or better rates for long leases ? I can reduce it by 250 a month for a longer lease and also if you move in by the end of the month I could reduce the rent to 2 200 a month which includes the electric . That sounds like a great deal . I can do a 2 year lease at $ 2200 , and I need a place right now so I can move in as soon as one is available .
If you can pick them up tonight , I will give them to you for $ 8 . I sure can ! What brand by the way ? Nokia .
In that case I would love to make a deal . I was hoping you w oud l accept $ 250 ? That 's not quite enough for this . I would possibly be able to get down to 300 if that would work for you . $ 300 seems fair , deal .
Could you take $ 4 200 for it ? $ 24 00 is too low . Its electric , you aren 't going to pay for gas ever . I could come down to probably $ 75 00 if you come pick it up . How about $ 68 00 ?

hi .
Ok . Well since I 'm buying it as a gift for my son , I might need to change the pe gs so it might be an additional cost for me in it . Would you be willing to lower the price for me ? I would go a little lower but I can not give it away . I understand that . How about 120 dollars ?

I just checked and it 's the same exact model selling for $ 160 new on e bay and am azon . Used they are like $ 80 , will you take 80 ? no way , and like I said not possible for this model . I say take your chance on there if you like , sounds like a scam . I can come down slightly to 125 but that is it . It is definitely the same one with comments from buyers on am azon . Will you take 95 ?
I assure you that the condition is like new . I paid 120 for it so I will not go any lower than $ 75 . I could do 50 bucks and pick it up today , but that 's really the most I 'm able to spend . $ 65 and it 's yours .
I 'm starting at $ 75 . Are you willing to go any lower for it ? I would like to spend 67 dollars at the most for it . You 're only asking for $ 8 less , and I can assure you you 're paying for a quality chest .
I tested it and it is functional with no missing parts . I will be happy to demo it before cash exchanges . That sounds great , I can stop by today . W O uld you take 35 for the console ? Do you have any watches laying around ? I would take $ 35 with a watch ( working or not ).

The most I can pay is $ 750 for a used dining set .
This looks amazing ! Is it cable ready ? Of course . It has everything you can imagine ! Is there a pool in the area ?
I could do 450 , but that is about as low as I can go . I really hate to part with it . $ 450 is too high for me . I can come up with $ 400 if you could deliver . 425 and I 'll deliver it .

Would you take $ 184 for it considering the d ents ? for 195 i will bring it to you right now . If you agree to $ 184 then I can come and pick it up .
yes , it 's a top notch custom job ... everything is custom except the frame : D . how about 425 ? 425 is a little rich for my blood . I 'm going to have to get it painted before I can give it to my kid . i have spent more than 350 on modifications .. can you do 375 with you arranging pickup ? i am in a hurry .
Yes , sure . How much are you hoping to spend on it ? I was hoping to not go over $ 800 . Hey , that is fine by me . I am willing to give it to you for 800 dollars .
I 'm more interested in a lower rent . How about 1100 ? Can we meet in the middle ? $ 1600 ? How about 1500 ?

That is actually for each bike but if you take both I can do $ 40 . Oh , I was hoping the $ 25 was for both I thought it was about $ 12 per bike . Well if you can come get them right away I can let you have them both for $ 25 I really don 't have much use for them anymore .
That is still more than I can afford . I am trying to save in order to hopefully buy my own house . I will tend to the grounds weekly and I can install the carpet myself . I can pay $ 2000 a month . I 'm sorry , that is too low for a rental in this area . 2500 is my final offer . Would you consider $ 21 00 .
That is a little steep how about 155 . I can have it in your hands tomorrow . Also I can give tips on setting up or for a nominal 15 dollar fee I can help you install . If you waive the fee , and help set it up for 155 we have a deal . how about I set up for a minimal 5 dollars giving you a total of 160 flat .

Hi . How long have you had this item ?
$ 115 and I 'll deliver it . Well , I 'm emb ar assed to say . My girlfriend won 't let me spend more than $ 110 . 110 and you pick it up ?
The bike is in good condition and there is nothing wrong with it . It 's a great 26 " cruiser . I have it listed for $ 250 . The listing says it is for $ 200 are you saying that 's not the right price ? My end is showing that I listed it for $ 250 . We can work on the price though .

All new parts and rarely rid en . I would not accept 100 . 00 I would work on my asking price of 1200 . 00 though . I was asking if you would take 1100 not 100 . Sorry I should have been more specific . Sounds lie k a great bike , why are you selling it ?
Hello ! I am interested in the bike you posted ! What did you replace when you did the tune up ?
Hi -- I 'm interested in the Lewis Ap artment Communities and would like to know more .
no actually utilities are extra , the neighborhood is nice , full of good people that don 't hesitate to help in case you need them . Okay , in that case I am offering a price of $ 3 123 considering that I have to take care of all utilities . I see your point but I can go down to 32 50 , you 'll live the place , it ' fully remod eled so it feels like a brand new home .
would i have to pick it up or do you deliver ? I can deliver them , free delivery if you live within 10 miles , otherwise delivery is $ 25 . Awesome would you take 450 by chance ?
There are in good condition ! What kind of wood are they ? If I pick them up tonight would you take $ 200 ? I nice dark pine wood and I would like to make a deal but I would only go as low as 350 .
Hi , this is a great deal for this  iph one . Complete ly unlocked , yes any network . Are there any problems with it ? There are a couple of d ings around the edges and it has a new screen with a screen protector .

Only other question is , is it in a decent neighborhood ? Yes a great neighborhood , with a homeowners association and everything . It is safe for children . Great ! Would you accept $ 9 47 ?
Sure thing ! It 's a beautiful glossy black , erg onomic grips , and it compatible with PC and Mac . That sounds like what I am looking for . The ad says it is " new ", does that mean that it is still sealed in the box ? Yes , it is still sealed in the box .
Has it been street ridden or more on hills , etc .? I see it has a Sh ox seat . A little of both but only a few times . Very little use . I 'd love to see it . Only issue is my budget is around $ 800 . Would you be willing to work with me ?

I can tell by the photo that the apartment is in good shape , however I think that 1500 for that area is a little steep . Would you be willing to negotiate the price with me ? I can go a little lower does 12 50 suit you a little better ? I can tell that you have kept the apartment in pristine shape and really seem to care about it . I am an excellent tenant and will treat the property as if it were my own . My budget only allows for 1050 , but I can also m ow the lawn and do the outdoor upkeep if you are willing .
Hi , have you tested these speakers recently ? I have not but my grandfather used them all the time up until he died and they worked and sounded great . It says in the ad that your grandfather passed away " a couple of years ago ." I 'm sorry for your loss by the way . I want vintage but I want vintage that works . How about I pay 75 , and I 'll take them as is , no questions asked .

Well I would love to become a tenant . I see you have 200 dollars off right now , but I don 't need the granite counter tops . If I volunteered to lived on one of the floors with Form ica , how does 28 35 a month sound ?

I used it only for occasional weekend rides with my family down our neighborhood streets . Did you purchase it brand new ? Or buy it used ? It was brought brand - new 2 years ago .

Hi , you 're interested in leasing ? Yes . I have a few questions though . Sure , how can I help you ?
Oh that 's great for what I 'm looking for , and one more question , do you know what a green belt is . fitness center equ iment i 'm asking $ 14 87 can work with you also . Do you think we could go down to $ 11 30 .
Hello there . I am interested in this product . Can you give me few details about it please ? As pictured , it has slight damage , and the top drawer sticks occasionally , but all in all it 's very functional . I 'm asking for 75 $ for it .
ex cellent it is in excellent condition . Do you have additional information about it ? 24 pounds . sh im ano de ore  xt cr anks et . egg be ater pedals disc brakes . rock sh oc racing fork ds . r itcher comp handle bars and stem . indeed this bike is state of the art .
That 's good , but I 'm not so sure I want to pay so much for such an old car . How about $ 46 00 ? I couldn 't come down nearly that low . Car is in great shape , and only 60 k miles . This car is good for at least another 140 k miles , perhaps more with really good care . I could come down to $ 6000 if that helps you . I suppose I could stretch that much in a month or two , but right now the most I can do is $ 55 00 .
I 'd like to get one for around $ 770 but then I found your bike , it seems like a really nice bike with great features and in great condition . Anything else you can tell me about it ? Yes this was passed down by what we call celebrity fam . This is where the bicycle was used by a celeb for one month and then they gifted it to another celeb . So if you buy you will be getting a great bike with an even better history ! Oh wow that sounds awesome . Could you sell it for $ 900 and I 'll come and pick it up from your place ?
Hello . Hello . What are you looking for ? I am looking for a studio , what 's the price please ?
I see that . It is a beautiful bike . I don 't want to seem che ep , but I just moved up here in this area and I am looking for a good bike to ride the mountain trails . My budget only stands at $ 550 , will you be able to take my offer ? I appreciate your offer but it is really much too low . this bike is light weight , has new components and has hardly been used . I would like an offer close to $ 1000 . How about $ 526 , I pick it up today and pay in cash ?

Great . It is a great home . Can you give me more details ? Is the home furnished ? Have any pets lived in the home ? Any ghosts ? No ghosts and no pets have been in the home .
They are not included . Its is PG & E . Since I will be responsible for the utilities would you consider coming down on your asking price ? I would . I will come down to 3 , 300 .

Could you assemble it to a certain specification before I pick it up ? I can if you drop the price to 210 .
What is the condition of the bicycle ?
No ghosts and no pets have been in the home . Ok I would like to move in today , I can offer you $ 12 50 cash . The house is not available until tomorrow and 12 50 won 't even touch rent in this area . The lowest I can go is $ 2000 .

great . 55 it is . ok .
To be honest , I 've never used the timer option on it , so I 'm not entirely sure . The amount of time I used it was mainly for casual photography . Oh ok can you do 161 ? $ 161 sounds like a reasonable offer , you have yourself a deal .
It is a nice , large three bed r rom one bat th located centrally . Awesome ! I see the location and it really suits me well . How much is the place ? I 'd like to only be paying like $ 35 00 max . It is $ 33 95 . It 's in a small , 9 unit building .
Sure , a little . What would you like to offer ? It 's a great bike , and well worth the money . Would you accept 110 ? I can do $ 125 . Would that work for you ?
I does still have factory warranty . I can offer you $ 50 for it and come get it today . It is in really good condition I am asking $ 100 but willing to negotiate for the right price . I was thinking around $ 85 .
Hey there , nice bike you got . Looking for a cheap bike for my k idd o . This is definitely a perfect one ! Not cheap , but a classic ! Classic ? Did you do some customization or detailing ? Not sure I can justify going over 25 if not .
I work in NYC and had been renting there as well but its ridiculously expensive . Is this per month ? I am just thinking close to 1000 / month as my rent in n y c is 1200 month . Yes this is the per month price . I would not be able to go that low . This apartment is brand new , partially furnished , and has wood floor ing . Similar apartments in the area are going for around $ 17 00 so this is really a steal ! how about 1400 / month but I will put 1000 down right now .
I am asking $ 200 , great condition ! no d ents or scratches ! Awesome ! Can you deliver it if I pay $ 200 ? Or can you let it go for like $ 190 and Ill come pick it up from you . I can surely deliver it for $ 200 as long as your local !

What is the least you will accept for it ? i would be willing to lower the price to $ 175 if you can pick it up . I 'm really interest in this and I think 175 is fair .
Y ea , thats up to you . I 'm looking for 37 00 , but I would be willing to willing with you . Well all things considered I think I could do $ 31 50 . How does that sound ? How about 3 , 300 ?
It is pretty much new . I got it about two months ago and it is in perfect condition . Does it come with all the cables and paperwork ? Yes it does .
How about 2100 and I throw in a free bottle of wine each month ? Deal ! Great 2100 it is , thank you .
It is light blue with some white . Would you take $ 210 for it ? It 's barely used . If you can get it by the weekend I could sell it for $ 250 .
I am available M - F after 4 pm and all day Saturday and Sunday . Would you accept $ 337 if I came today ? $ 340 cash and you have a deal .
Nice , how about $ 27 ? that is agreeable . Deal !
Is there any way I could rent it for the first six months for 1500 and then we could go to 1700 after the first six months . I could do 1600 for the first six and then 1700 after that . ok so 1600 will be good for me the first six months .

this is a perfect little studio for ber ke ly students . you can walk to classes . Hi I 'm allergic to pollen so the outside without my car or other protective gears is not an option for me . I was hoping that you could tell me about the apartment inside , is it clean and also I cannot pay 1500 total , are you able to go down and or guarantee the air is nice ? Air will be as nice as Berkeley air can be . You 'll have to deal with your condition on your own , but there is no more pollen here than anywhere else in Berkeley . and all ut ilies AND internet is included . all you do is pay rent and you 're done for the month .
The frame looks great , but I 'm concerned about maintenance costs and more fragile components . Would you be interested if I delivered it to you for free and dropped the price to $ 775 ? Free delivery is a perk to me , but I think the parts you 've listed are only worth about $ 500 .
There are many amenities . The location is right next to a freeway and there is a shopping mall next door . The home features a was her and dry er as well as being pet friendly . Ok sounds good . Would you accept an offer of 22 80 ? No , we need to get at least $ 26 00 .
The original price was $ 1200 . I think my price of $ 290 . is fair considering it still looks like new . I will buy it cash for 200 and pick it up tonight . I will split it with you for $ 240 and i will throw in the new s ge ets also .
Hi are you still selling the tri ke ? Yes the tri ke is still here . Are there any problems with it what condition is it in ?
hello I am very interested in renting your house .
The second chair is in the same exact condition . I just wanted to have a clear picture of one to show the details well . That makes sense . I see they are listed for $ 65 but that 's a bit pricey for me . I 'm a college student trying to furnish my first place . Would you be willing to accept $ 20 for them . I 'd even pick them up myself . Being that I recently graduated college I do understand how money can be tight , but unfortunately that is a bit too low for me to part with them . If you are willing to come up some in price , or could throw something else in , we may be able to work something out .
Are you interested in my apartment listing . I am ! Unfortunately I 'm more in the budget for a space priced around $ 647 . Have I mentioned that this amazing apartment comes with parking , and is within walking distance to BART ? The view isn 't much and it does have a lot of Sec 8 people but is fairly priced for it 's size and location . I 'll bottom line it for ya . I need the lease and am willing to cover your moving expenses and knock $ 300 off the monthly lease price .

Cool , is the 25 per bike or is that for both ? That is actually for each bike but if you take both I can do $ 40 . Oh , I was hoping the $ 25 was for both I thought it was about $ 12 per bike .
I am but i have some questions first . Does this place come with any utilities included in the asking price ? What is the neighborhood like ? no actually utilities are extra , the neighborhood is nice , full of good people that don 't hesitate to help in case you need them . Okay , in that case I am offering a price of $ 3 123 considering that I have to take care of all utilities .
Are you interested in getting the chair for sale ? Hello , Are you willing to negotiate on price ? $ 40 is too much . Actually the ad says the seat is for sale at $ 50 . But I may be winning to come down on the price if you 're willing to provide your own transportation .
The dress er is 10 years old , but in great condition . Would you like to buy ? Has is been rep ainted ? It has been re - painted 5 years ago .
Hi how are you doing today ? Great , I a m interest in the printer , I was wondering if you would accept $ 270 for it , since I will need to by the ink to make sure it works .
Great , it will suit my space . What material is the shade made of ? wood and a special fiber from Dan emark . Thank you . It looks like it weights a few pounds , could you take $ 145 to help me offset shipping . I am buying it for my dad .
actually I had pulled out the old one to sell and was going to ask $ 100 for that one so that is why I am asking that for this one . But how much were you thinking ? How would you sell the old one if it was run over by the neighbor ? They ran it over while I was having a garage sale . I was asking 100 for it at that sale . After the accident I did not try to sell it .

Hey there . These apartments are going fast . $ 15 83 .
I had it for a month , it works great ! Ok . Would you be willing to sell it for $ 30 ? I can let you have it for $ 35 since there is a small mis - print in the ad .
Well , I 'm not sure I believe all that ... but it is nice to look at ... I could offer you 300 for it , and I could pick it up today ... That would be acceptable , at $ 350 . Is there any chance I could pay you 342 instead ... It 's a superst ition thing ... 350 is bad luck ...
Okay , well can you pick it up then ? yes I can pick them up and dis mat le as well . Sure ! Cash okay ?
Hi , I am interested in your item for sale . It looks great in the photo , can you tell me about about how old it is and what condition it is in ?
sure it should be good for a 10 year old . w old you be willing to take 150 if i came and picked up tonight ? $ 150 is very low . I would take $ 225 if you can come tonight to pick it up .
W ont find an unused one anywhere near this price anywhere . Can 't go lower than $ 300 . I 'm hosting a movie night with my friends and family and this would just push it over the top . My budget is literally $ 250 . Could we help each other here ? Sorry . $ 300 is my bottom .
Considering it 's from Ike a and I could wait for a sale , would you go down on the price with cash in hand ? I understand . I 'm asking for $ 40 , but what would you be willing to pay ? I have $ 28 and I could be there today and you won 't have to deal with tons of people backing out . I 'm motivated to buy now .

Is there a pool at the complex ? There is a pool , hot tub , exercise room and and outside basketball court . Awesome . 23 00 is a bit steep for me . How about $ 1800 ?
Yes very much so ! Is this new ? Well no this is vintage piece . It 's mid century and is a great vintage condition . and is the color as shown ?
Since it hasn 't been used in a while , the chain became rusty so that will need to be replaced . Also , the tire are in very good condition , but they need to be pumped with air . Is there any way you would take $ 30 for it ? Given the condition it is in . I was looking more at around $ 70 since I bought the bike at around $ 300 new . I go down to $ 50 , how does that sound ?
Hey so I have this Schw inn bike , it 's great for shorter people or kids . Would you accept $ 75 for the bike ? No way , it 's less than 6 months old .
yes I did and am very much interested . The question is , are you going to accept $ 84 for it ? No I just can 't do that . I can offer free delivery ! what 's the lowest you can offer ?
For a Be emer 5 series in this condition , I really can 't go that low . $ 3 , 500 . The highest I can go is $ 3000 . I 'm not in a hurry to sell it , we put a lot into it . Semi t ints all the way around , wired for audio , extra r ims . $ 3 200 .
the unit advertised for 9 79 is our 1 bedroom . All utilities are included . Ok not too bad I was looking for a little bit lower rent per month , do you by any chance have any specials going on ? I really need to be around $ 825 . If you are willing to come in and sign our 13 month lease today , I can waive your deposit . this would still keep rent at 9 79 but overall save you almost 1000 dollars .

Well it sounds like you would really like to get rid of the couch so what do you take $ 300 for it ? I can 't go that low . I paid over $ 1200 for it . I could do $ 500 . Okay I will give you 400 and take it off your hands .
The schools are within walking distance , and are award winning . Great ! What else is local ? There 's a park nearby . And there are convenient transportation options if you need to travel for work .
they 're the best ! And this one has been discontinued so you cant find it in stores anymore . What condition would you say it was in ? Like new because I only had it for 6 months and barely used it . It even still has some of its plastic wrapping from the store .
No stains on the chair covers and they are wash able and replace able if you do happen to stain them . would i have to pick it up or do you deliver ? I can deliver them , free delivery if you live within 10 miles , otherwise delivery is $ 25 .
What kind of gas mileage does it get ? I am averaging around 30 city / 37 highway . That 's good , but I 'm not so sure I want to pay so much for such an old car . How about $ 46 00 ?
Hi there , is the bike still available ? Yes it is , are you interested ? I am ! I see that you 're offering cash only in F ols om ... any chance you could go a little lower than your asking price if I came over in person , especially give the bike 's age ? Maybe 45 $ ? I know it 's a big ask .

A minor f ender - bender , but it 's since been repaired , so it 's un notice able . The Blue book value on this car is 10 k . Would that be the new blue book value or used blue book value ? Used , it 's mostly because it 's a Lex us with all the amenities and add - ons . I figure it 's decent to give it for 7 500 because of the history of a f ender b ender .
The most I can pay is $ 4 200 . If you can take it off my hands tonight , I 'll give it to you for 43 00 . I can do that , $ 43 00 it is .

That seems a little high for me . I would like to offer you $ 150 for it . that is somewhat low how about $ 245 . I 'm afraid I can 't go any lower than $ 200 .
I am not eager to see it go for 560 . This is a great MT B . But i will part with it if you are willing to get to 680 but that is the absolute lowest . I think 640 would be the highest I could go . ha h aha . let us meet in the middle to 660 ?

No accidents . It has a clean Car fax . Are there any d ings or imperfect ions in the paint ? No the paint is original . There is no imperfect ions .
That 's a bit more that I wanted to spend . Are the utilities included in the rent ? Water , gas , trash and cable is included . Electric is paid by the tenant . That does make a difference for me . Is there any w iggle room in the price ? Would you be willing to accept $ 17 00 ?

Oh got it . Okay , so since you need to get rid of it , what 's the lowest you are willing to get away for it ? I would like to get 8 500 but you can make an offer if you want . I am willing to spend about 5 100 because that 's about what I can fit in my budget at the moment . How can we work on it ?
no at all . Would you take $ 184 for it considering the d ents ? for 195 i will bring it to you right now .
does the wood have any scars or scratches ? None at all it is in very good shape . are you willing to accept 54 ?
Free delivery is a perk to me , but I think the parts you 've listed are only worth about $ 500 . That is a very big discount . I will add free delivery , maintenance for three months and a final price of $ 750 . That 's not a very big price drop . What about $ 600 ?

Dep ends where you use it but it should get great reception .
Would you be willing to bring it up to $ 1 , 500 ? I can do $ 1 , 500 if you include the parking fees . I think that 's acceptable for both of us , we can go ahead and submit this offer if that 's alright with you ?

that works for me . How about the utilities ? If you are willing to pay full price , I 'll pay the utilities . I am willing to pay $ 11 65 .
I 'm sorry I do not except trades . 55 bucks is the absolute max I can go . I can 't do $ 55 . Sorry .
The bike is in great shape and has lots of expensive add on s . I couldn 't let it go for anything under $ 700 . How many speeds does this bike have ? 12 speed .
So it truly is in good condition ? Yes . Well , that is good , and for a fair price as well , however I am a little short on money this week . could we agree on $ 225 ?
I would like to buy your ch andel ier .
I see . How many miles are on the car ? 170 , 000 and such 57 00 is a more than fair price . That 's quite a bit . Are you willing to negotiate for a lower price ?

[1, 6, 7, 1, 0, 5, 3, 5]
-----------------------------

-----------------------------
I can go $ 15 if you are willing to deliver . If was planning on having you come and pick it up 14 and you have a deal . As long as you come pick it up yourself ! ok $ 14 and I 'll get someone to pick it up for me .
I can make 10000 work without the extras . I just can 't afford that . Are the tires new ? Is there a sun ro of ? If yes , I will come up with 7 500 tops . That is a deal or no deal price for me . I can 't do that . But based on the year your local credit union would issue you a small loan for the balance . It is new enough to still qualify for new car rates .
Yeah , that 's still too high ., I can do 2 year lease for 900 , how does that sound ? $ 900 is a bit low for us . We are centrally located so you have a lot of stores nearby . It is a very convenient location and also we have a list of people who are also interested especially because of location . The lowest I am willing to go is $ 13 50 . i see , well good luck to you . this won 't work for me .
Well , do you happen to know how easy it is to flash dd w rt to the device ? I have no idea . Sorry . Well , then I 'd be taking a gamble on it . I 've had other ubiqu ity a ps and half the time I can flash them and half the time they 'll just brick . So I suppose I 'd be willing to take a gamble and offer you $ 30 .
Nice . Well it 's a little over my budget and the way it is the book value is around $ 6000 . Since it 's clean and just what I 'm looking for I 'm willing to go higher . Can you do around $ 65 00 ? My lowest offer is 7000 . That 's just a bit too high . Can we meet in the middle at $ 67 50 ? I 'd be willing to come pick it up and you can leave it with an empty tank of gas .
I see that . it 's perfect for my 14 year old girl who is around 5 ' 4 . tell you what ? I 'll give you 500 ? That 's really a top limit for me on these things . Wo ah that 's like 300 dollars less right away . That 's a big loss for me ! I can 't go that low . I see . well you know it 's still a bike ,. no one should pay more than 500 for a used bike , you know ? tell you what , how 's 600 for you ? I come and pick it up and take it off your hand . you no longer have to worry about it .
You 're getting 4 pairs ! I don 't think $ 10 each is too much . Plus they still have some battery life in them . Are they recharge able ? As I mentioned I don 't know the tech y stuff , but I imagine you could google them to see . I 'm sorry ... You will not be able to find these for less than $ 15 each .

Wait your studios are the same price as your 2 bed 2 bath how does that work ? Yes they are but the studios are around the same size as the 2 bed 2 bath apartments and the studios have balcony access and special parking permits . Wow that is a big studio . Well as I said I was trying to stay around 400 I could do 550 since it does include util ites . If you can work with that price I will even sign a 2 year lease .
Okay , what do you feel it 's worth then ? Since it has no scratches , and is still in fantastic condition , I think it is worth more like $ 130 . It 's two models old though . I can offer you $ 110 but that 's as high as I 'll go .
I am not sure exactly how old the set is but I 've had it for over 20 years and we had purchased it second hand . My guess is as old as 30 years ... each piece is in great condition . Oh wow , yea the picture shows a great finish on that table . If we decide to come get it from you , is it on the first floor of your home or second floor ? It 's on the first floor in our dining room .
$ 96 , seeing as you found the shade and lamp se perate . Well I paid more than that for the two of them , and they really do go very well together . I could go as low as 120 I think , considering you 're a student . My top is $ 110 .. could that work ?

Hi . Hello , I 'm very interested in the dining set . Would you be willing to take less than $ 600 ? I am desperate .
New sim card . Original everything . Always had a screen protector . I 'm asking $ 160 which is a pretty good discount from what you 'd pay at the Apple store . I think $ 100 . 00 is more reasonable since it is like new condition . It is a phone and there are no other perks available . They 're selling for $ 210 on Amazon without the Sim Card . I 'll take $ 150 to get a deal done now , but otherwise I 'm not in a hurry to sell . What do you think ?
I 've been away at school , no one has really used it except for my grandmother to go to church . All the info is in the Car F ax . Could you take $ 4 200 for it ? $ 24 00 is too low . Its electric , you aren 't going to pay for gas ever . I could come down to probably $ 75 00 if you come pick it up .
Quite awhile now , it 's been at our home as long as I can remember . But it 's reliable and an awesome son ner man lamp . I see the price is $ 65 , would you take $ 45 ? How ab ut I meet you halfway and agree on $ 55 ?
Am I responsible to pay monthly utility fees ; such as : water , electricity , garbage ? Those are included in the listing price . Would you accept an offer of $ 27 60 ?
I 'm not quite sure on the exact age , but its a newer build house , it has central heating and air , and large double pane windows , plus a large back patio , so its not too dated at all . Cool . Do you allow pets ? Yes pets are allowed , the backyard would be great for a dog !

I would be willing to offer 350 for the rug , cash in hand . Hmm . It is definitely worth more than that considering it is vintage and has rare pink and earth tones . I could do 450 . Well , lets just skip all the back and forth and say we meet in the middle at 400 cash today , and we both feel we did okay in the deal .
Hey there ! Hi , is the Pleasant on 4 bedroom still available ? It sure is ! It 's going for $ 37 00 , has all appliances included , and the neighborhood is fantastic , even more so if you have children !
nothing wrong at all pretty much new . Okay . I see that you are listing it at 300 . However , I can buy a new one for that . Honestly , without any sort of warranty available and the fact that it is used - I can do 150 . it actually still has over 10 months of the warranty that comes with the bike when you buy it . I will not go as low as 150 . I can do 225 though .
good how are you . I am interested in your beautiful home for sale . I am great , thanks for asking ! I 'd be happy to sell it to you ! what would you say is its most prominent feature .

Hello . What are the key features of this car ?
Hi I 'm interested in purchasing your 1998 Truck with all the equ p ment included . Okay . Price is a little flexible , but with all the equipment it is worth about the asking price . Any other questions ? Yes , the price is a little high for such an old truck with over 200 k miles . Would you accept an offer of $ 9 , 000 .
do you offer delivery . I could deliver for the asking $ 125 cash . Whenever works for you . would you consider coming down some ? Like maybe 115 with delivery ?
h mmm ... that 's an expense I was not counting on . What do you call a fair price ? $ 4000 Is the asking price , I can assure you it is worth well over that . I think 4000 is a little high for a house with no appliances . I was looking more at 2 200 .

Perfect . I want it . I can come pick up today . Would u take $ 25 ? How about $ 35 ? The most I could go right now is $ 29 .

hello , is your lamp still for sale ?
Is the TV still available ?
Can you tell me more about your bike ? It 's a 2015 C rave Pro . It 's in perfect condition and comes with lots of delicious features . Only ridden 100 miles . I 'm asking $ 1100 .
That sounds like a pretty good deal . Would you also like to stop by and have a look at it first ? Of course when is a good time and date for you i am completely open ? How about tomorrow at 12 noon ?
Yes absolutely . I can do that . If you can bring $ 625 cash I 'll do it . I can do $ 600 if that 's fine ?
Interested in your Blu - ray player . Would you be willing to come down on the price if I come to you to pick it up ? no , if i can 't get 20 dollars for it , i 'll just keep it .
I could probably negotiate on the price but not too much . Honda Acc ords retain their res ale value and this one is in good condition with few miles . How about 6000 dollars for it ? That seems fair to me . No that would be a huge price cut and you haven 't really offered any justification for such a price cut . Blue Book value of this car is right in line with what I have it listed for .
I am interested .

Hi , i 'm int rest ed in the house . it sound great . Is it moder , traditional ranch , do you know the architectural style ? I 'm not quite sure on the name . but it looks splendid . It 's a huge house , 16 51 sq feet . 3 bedroom 1 bath . animals approved *. Is there a fence in the backyard ? Does it have central AC ? Is there a driveway / gar age or is it street parking ?
I am averaging around 30 city / 37 highway . That 's good , but I 'm not so sure I want to pay so much for such an old car . How about $ 46 00 ? I couldn 't come down nearly that low . Car is in great shape , and only 60 k miles . This car is good for at least another 140 k miles , perhaps more with really good care . I could come down to $ 6000 if that helps you .
Top of the m ern in to ya . How are you doing this fine day ? Im doing great ! How about you ? I like the coffee table , is it in good shape ?
Hi how are you today ?
I like the desk . Does it o c me with a chair ? It actually does not come with a chair . I am only selling a desk .

hello . Hi just one owner on this fully loaded car . Great for commuting to work and features to talk someone into car pool ing . Nice , I 'll give you 10 k cash .
I have there , I am interested in the bike , but I am taller , do you think it would be okay since I am 5 ' 9 '' ? Well it probably would be a bit small . If that 's something your comfortable with then it 'd be okay though . h mmm , how old is this bike ?
hi .
Hello .
I can do 400 last that 's about 150 less than what I am selling it . I think its a fair price . How about we meet in the middle somewhere ? $ 385 and I 'll still come and get it . ; ). okay 385 sounds okay to me but I am just doing that for you since you 're insisting a lot !
More speed ? Does that mean the d eral ie ur has been replaced ? that is correct , I repeat that is correct , near the back tire . OK . So looking at new models of this bike , I see they sell for about $ 13 00 . $ 1200 seems a bit high , but you have taken great care of it . Would you be willing to consider an offer of $ 900 cash and I will come and pick it up ?
Hello , so you got these with your phone ? you 've never used them right ? I have never used them . They are only five bucks so you cannot go wrong with them . That 's true , that 's a pretty good price . Would you ship them since they 're so small ?

Hi ! Yes , I am interested in your arm chairs . $ 600 seems a bit steep for me . Would you take $ 420 ? It is really like new been used only once I would accept 500 as the lowest and I will deliver it to you for free . I feel like $ 480 may be a little more in my price range . I know they are like new , but $ 500 seems like the price for a brand new ( straight from the store and delivered ) price .
I will need to have some work done on it , it sounds like . Maybe an electrical problem somewhere . Its for my daughter , she 's going to college next month . How old are the tires ? I can 't go that low , unfortunately . The tires alone are practically new , and were $ 700 new . I can drop it to $ 3 , 900 . Sweet . Okay . I can go as high as $ 22 50 . But that 's really all I can afford at this time .
Hi . I 'm interested in the alarm clock radio . Hello . I have listed this item for $ 12 . You said you 'd be willing to lower the price in the listing -- would you take 4 dollars ?
Yes I am interested . What kind of condition is it in ? Great , it 's actually the spare we kept in the back room of our company that we only used like 5 times over 6 months we 've had it . Okay well I see this item selling for $ 50 new how about I give you $ 25 for it ?
i 'm afraid that is a little low , but i 'm willing to work with you . if you come and pick it up , I 'd be willing to let go of if for $ 475 . this fine wal nut dress er is worth it . I can pick it up now for $ 400 cash . make it $ 450 and we have a deal .
I can 't go that high . It 's a lot for 170 , 000 miles . 12 years old . Can you come down ? How low did you have in mind ? $ 37 00 is in my budget .
Hi what can you tell me about this dress er ? its very attractive . mid - century modern style . lots of space with 6 draw ers . vintage condition . it was grandma 's and she took great care of it . i 'm asking $ 550 . How large is this item ?
The Su v comes with a new cd player with blu etooth , d vd player , hid head light and has r ims . That 's great ! The price seems a little steep though . Would you be willing to ac ce p 2 200 ? This car only has 130 k miles so it 's low mileage and runs great ! no major mechanical problems .

Hey ! Saw your listing for the 2 mag na bikes and would be interested in them for my kids . Looks like a little damage on them though . Would you be able to part with them for $ 15 ? Not to much damage . Main ly need tire tubes and the seats have a little wear . I was trying to ger $ 25 out of them .
Is the title clean ? Are u the first owner ? yes to both questions . I know it 's pretty rare but the title is clean and it runs great . That sounds great . Im guessing the interior is in good condition and no scratches ? How does $ 2000 sound ?
Awesome ! It 's in great condition and works perfectly for an adult plus a small kid . All 7 gears work well , its really nice paint job . I 'm asking for $ 100 for it . I don 't know it seems pretty old . Any chance of dropping it to $ 40 ? I want it , but not that bad . It 's not old , its in almost perfect condition , its not going to break or wear down anytime soon . One in this condition will net you around $ 150 as is . The lowest I can go is $ 75 if you come to my place and can pick it up from me , as I can 't really deliver it right now .
Cool , are you willing to pay the forty five dollars ? Can we do 35 ? I 'll come pick it up today if you can . Would it be possible for you to do 40 ? I will meet you half way somewhere .
Well thanks for checking out the listing ! Gas mileage is great and you wont have to worry about refuel ing on your trips out of state . its around 29 on highways . That sounds great . I travel for work so that is very important . Are the tires new or will I need to replace them shortly if I purchase the car ? its a 2016 . The tires are spectacular ! Its only got 8 k miles on engine , so there is a ton of tread left for you to coast through the sunset with . You 're also getting key less entry in this model as well as ALL leather interior .
Hello ! How are you ? Are you interested in this Pri us ?
Well I believe it 's worth 160 so asking you for 120 is already a good deal . My absolute lowest is 115 and that 's really just take it or leave it . I can 't give it away . You drive a hard bargain really can 't offer anything to sweet en the deal ? I tried to but you weren 't interested . I can only offer you the fact that you won 't regret buying it . It 's a really cool piece .
Yes ! I had brought this as a gift but they already had them ! I am asking $ 499 but I will negotiate for a fair price . Would you take 450 for them ? Ok $ 450 sounds fair you will not be disappointed .

500 and its yours . I really can 't go lower than that . You can ! $ 475 ? No , sorry .
Used , it 's mostly because it 's a Lex us with all the amenities and add - ons . I figure it 's decent to give it for 7 500 because of the history of a f ender b ender . Do you have all of the service records for it ? Y up , and the title .
Yes , I used them for about 6 months before my husband bought me an iPhone for my birthday . Not bad ! how much ? $ 5 each !
Hi ! I am interested in the wing back chair . I would like to offer $ 20 .
It sure is ! It 's going for $ 37 00 , has all appliances included , and the neighborhood is fantastic , even more so if you have children ! Sounds great ! How old is the house ? I 'm not quite sure on the exact age , but its a newer build house , it has central heating and air , and large double pane windows , plus a large back patio , so its not too dated at all .
Does it have any issues , i want to buy it for my son so I need to make sure it is safe . It has no issues like that at all , perfectly safe . It just has a couple areas with ch ipped paint . Sounds good . Could you take $ 1000 for it . I would be happy to pick it up .
hi there . Hello ! Are you interested in the house ? Yes I am . Can you give me some details about the location ?
Hello , I like your wind mill and might be interested in buying it ... can you tell me a bit about it ...

HI ! I 've very interested in the bike you have for sale !
Hmm , how about 50 and I 'll throw in a free dinner for two at a restaurant I own ? What 's the name of your restaurant ? Out back Ste ak house .
Awesome . 23 00 is a bit steep for me . How about $ 1800 ? Well , I could lower the price some . I was thinking about $ 21 00 . You should come by and take a look . We are generally available from 8 : 30 to 1 . I could show it to you in the evening as well . I guess I can swing $ 21 00 . I 'll check it out .
I can shave $ 100 off if you 're able to pick up today but I 've put a lot of work into this tri ke and can 't really go much lower . $ 1200 . I can do $ 1100 , if you can deliver to me tomorrow ? $ 1100 but you 'll need to pick it up yourself .
I can offer you 15 000 ? i wish I could take that offer , my neighbor offered me 17 000 , I would be willing to sell it to you for that price as well . It 's in prestigious condition , a steal for that price . 17 000 would work .
Certainly , you can come down to our office during normal business hours to take care of the paperwork . Awesome . If I signed a 2 year lease could we work out the price a little bit ? I 'm willing to move in as ap and pay $ 2 160 a month . $ 2 160 . 00 won 't be possible at this time . I can lower the rent to $ 22 50 . 00 a month but that 's the lowest I can go .
I just bought it a month ago . I haven 't even taken it out of the box ! But I found out I 'm getting transferred , so decided to sell it . I would love to pick it up today , but the price is a little out of my budget . can you come lower ? Don 't forget it has 2 chairs with it also ! So I could accept $ 180 if you can pick it up .
It is a ' 04 though with some miles on it . I could do $ 4 , 000 on it . Cash in hand today as long as I can test drive and all is well . I need to at least cover what it cost to put that transmission in - I 'd like to get at least $ 43 00 . I will throw in gr ann ys sub and amp too , she was quite the gang ster rap af icion ado . I could make good use of those . $ 4 200 and you got a deal . I can come today .

Hi . I am interested in your desk , yes . 60 Sounds a bit high for me though . would you be willing to go down to 30 ? i would meet you in the middle at 45 . It 's hard to let it go for too low . I bought it for 150 . Would you be willing to pick it up at my house ? I would be willing to pick it up , but how bout 35 since I am the one picking it up ?
It actually isn 't used , it is right out of the box . T ried it on and didn 't like it . i see . why didn 't you like it ? not as good as other wear ables ? It wasn 't my style , it was a gift . I prefer more of the band style watches as opposed to a normal watch look .
I 'm not sure I can buy it then how will I ever get to work . I 'm sure you could find a tele comm uting position . Lol . All right good point will you go down on the price ?
Hi there . Is the apt still available ? yes it is . Full kitchen , beautiful inside out . No smoking an d no pet please . that works for me . How about the utilities ?

Hello how are you doing ? Hey Im fine and you ! Is the apartment still available . Yes there are a few at 2 295 do you need more information ?
How about noon ? Perfect .. You got a deal .... see you at noon . deal .
That 's a little more than we 're looking to pay . Could you include utilities in the price at all ? Especially if we have that pet fee . If you can pay $ 14 87 I will include utilities . And where are your apartments located ?
Ok Im willing to pay $ 360 for it . That 's a bit low for this . There are only 4 like this that are available . ok how about $ 370 I like the chair but it is used and you also can 't gar unte e comfort .
yes it is lets start at 2 296 . 00 . I was looking to offer you $ 11 47 . that is not fair you knocked off more than half for a 2 bedroom 2 bath luxury apartment with security and video and g ated and private parking garage .

Hi there ! Are you interested in the glasses ?
can you tell me how much it weighs and the dimensions ? Its not that heavy you can move it around and it fits perfectly in any corner room .
$ 2000 . $ 2500 and that 's low as I can go . This home features stainless steel appliances , wood floor ing and a renovated bath . What about a cleaning service for 6 months and I can do 2500 .
I would like to get $ 3000 out of it at least .. Has many upgrades to it . I see that but considering that it 's a bit older I would like to pay about $ 24 00 . I can 't got that low .. $ 29 00 is as low as I can got .. Sp ent way more than that on it .
Would you consider 23 40 $ ? That is too low for such a fantastic town house . This has a 2 car attached garage , patio , covered side deck . It is close to downtown , parks , restaurants , and public transit . i did not see that it had a 2 car garage . That is great . It seems perfect for my small family of 3 .
The chest was $ 120 brand new , and I think $ 40 is far too low . I can certainly sell it to someone else for my asking price of $ 75 -- a bargain ! Yes , but the chest is used and that knocks at least 50 % off the price . How about $ 50 ? I am not certain 50 % off is accurate . Have you ever bought a used car or house ? How about $ 65 ?
No , there are no scratches , d ents , or anything else . It 's in great condition . Any other questions ? Sweet . Can I come and pick it up from you guys for $ 450 ? I can 't go that low but would you buy for $ 550 ?
That 's great . Is it comfortable to sit on and watch TV ? What size is it ? It is ! The mattress is a full size , 54 " by 75 ". The frame measures 6 feet 9 . 5 inches in length , seat is 2 feet 6 inches from the ground . Just what I need . Would you be willing to come down on the price a bit ?

Hi I am interested in your bike . Great , do you have any questions ? I was wondering if you are willing to take 100 less for it ? Also where did you keep the bike ?

I am willing to drive but I 'm not local . For that reason I want it at least 345 . If you can be here tomorrow , I will do 345 . I have new furniture coming and need it gone as ap .
It 's about 5 years old . are you willing to accept $ 300 for it ? I 'm sorry but I can 't go that low . I can do $ 450 , if that helps you .

Hello . I noticed your ad for the batteries . I need one for my phone , since the battery on my phone is starting to go . I really only needed one battery , but you are the only listing I 've seen so far . Could you consider $ 6 ? They 're basically a set since I have no use for them . They both work great . I can negotiate but $ 6 is a bit low ... I could go $ 7 and throw in the charger because I don 't need that anymore either .
I really need more than that , I tell you what , give me $ 15 and I 'll give you some of my w if es fresh chocolate chip cookies . I can 't pay $ 15 . The last I can pay is $ 13 . I think that 's a sweet deal . I guess I can take $ 13 , but no cookies for you .
Do you still have the apartment in Liver more ? Yes I have a unit in Liver more . They don 't last long !
It 's all painted in be ige right now . You can make changes to it as you please as long as it 's back to standard once you move out . 1600 . $ 1975 is the lowest I can go . I still maintenance and other expenses to pay on my end .
Sure thing . The cou ches themselves are in fine condition . They are completely clean and come from a smoke and pet - free home . The only defect is that some of the z ippers attaching the cush ions to the frame are broken . Ok . That might be a problem . Because of the defect I am willing to pay $ 50 . How does that price sound to you ? That 's fair . For a few dollars extra , I 'll deliver them to your home personally . That 's around $ 60 .

Hi , I am very interested in this item , but the highest I can pay is $ 900 . hello this is a really nice dining room set in great condition . $ 900 is a bit low would you be willing pay $ 975 . I can meet you in the middle at $ 950 but that 's all the cash I have available . I can pick it up and get it off your hands tonight for $ 950 .
Look , I know you are trying to save some money but this bike is in incredible shape . I would love to have this for my mother , she is very sick and this would help her and with me taking care of her and having to take a leave from work I can pay very much of it . I 'm willing to go down a bit but this thing is pretty good as it is , what were you thinking ?
If there are additional perks I can neg ociate higher . We could only negotiate in the rent amount only . Okay , we 'll final ize it for $ 14 00 . Ag ree ? 1000 and it 's a deal .
I am willing to negotiate . Do you have any pets ? i do a dog . W Ill that be a problem . Not at all ! We welcome pets , but there is an additional pet deposit required . No additional monthly pet fee .
Great . Unlike most tenants who may party which can lead to damages . I am a solitary home body . I do not smoke , party or have parties . I also am a fan atical clean freak and I love maintaining the grounds . I also do not have an pets . I would be willing to keep the grounds imm ac ulate for a reduced rent rate . If you 're willing to keep the grounds imm ac ulate , I 'd be willing to go down to 28 00 dollars per month . That is still more than I can afford . I am trying to save in order to hopefully buy my own house . I will tend to the grounds weekly and I can install the carpet myself . I can pay $ 2000 a month .
I am not certain 50 % off is accurate . Have you ever bought a used car or house ? How about $ 65 ? Yes I have bought both used before . Honestly , I just cannot afford the price . I just moved and I have had to pay a lot of costs plus a deposit . I need somewhere to put my clothes . Can you do $ 65 ? Yes ! We have a deal . It 's settled at $ 65 . Thanks .

I am . I have recently washed it and it is pet hair free and from a smoke free home . How long have you had this ? Seems like forever . It is wool and has lots of earth tones . I am asking $ 500 but I want it to go to a good home so that is slightly neg otion able .
Hey there ! I really need some s amsung 3 d glasses , and I saw yours ! Are they good quality and will they work 100 % with my plasma TV >. Yes We used them with our plasma TV before our tv broke . They are in good condition I am asking $ 40 for 4 glasses . Cool ! Could I get them for $ 30 if I come by with cash in a few hours and pick them up ? that would work very well with me .
That makes sense . Are there any chips in the paint or rust on it ? Nope ! Again , it 's only been used twice , so the condition is close to perfect . I 'm just looking to get rid of it ASAP . How does $ 800 sound ? That 's way too much for me . I understand it 's in good condition but it is a bit dated . How about $ 500 ?
Hi this looks like what i need right now . How old is the couch ? It 's not very old and we 've kept it in good condition too ! We got it about 2 years ago .

Hi are you interested in this dining table ? Yes I am ! It looks wonderful ! Exactly what I was looking for . How much $ are you looking for ? And is it in good condition , no d ents / sc rat ches / marks ? I am asking $ 200 , great condition ! no d ents or scratches !
Does it have any scratches or bumps ? A few minor ones , nothing major I would not even say normal wear and tear and I only rode it a few times . How long have you had it ?
Well , it 's not a bad price , but I will have to pay someone to deliver them to my house since I don 't have a truck . And they are black , which means I have to rep aint them to match the office . What about $ 50 ? $ 55 and we have a deal . I could only do $ 55 if you delivered them , then I wouldn 't have to pay someone else .
I like your Mazda 3 car . Cool , did you have any questions about the car ? Yes , has it been in any major accidents or had any major failures of the engine etc ?
12 50 and you have a deal , if you have any questions about the bike let me know . I 'll gladly take it for 12 50 , you 'll deliver right ? Y up , when will you be around ?
It is only a month old and in new condition . I can offer an extended warranty if you 're concerned about it being a month old ... I just don 't think it is fair to ask retail for something that is used . I would offer you $ 45 . Yeah that makes sense . I can do 50 with the extended warranty .
Hello is this still available for rent ? Yes , it is . Would you like to come take a tour ? I would . But first what can you tell me about h tis .
$ 690 and it is yours . Are you willing to go just a bit lower , perhaps $ 675 ? Ok , it 's a deal at $ 675 !

Hello - Are you interested in the apartment I have available ?
Any chance you would be willing to meet halfway for pickup ? If you pick the set up I can sell it for $ 75 . Hmm , how about 50 and I 'll throw in a free dinner for two at a restaurant I own ?
That 's really too low for me if I am going to also deliver them for you . Would you take $ 80 if I came and picked them up myself ? Okay , I will accept $ 80 .
That 's a little too steep for me . In antique guides , this is coming in , in perfect condition , at $ 200 - 350 . Would you take $ 300 if I pick it up tonight ? Cash deal . A store - b ought piece of this style would range you $ 750 -$ 1000 . $ 350 and we have a deal ! $ 400 and I 'll deliver . $ 350 sounds right .
I 'm sorry , I can 't part with it for that price . Could you possibly do $ 60 ? No . How about $ 50 . I can do $ 50 if you can pick it up today .
Well , I could lower the price some . I was thinking about $ 21 00 . You should come by and take a look . We are generally available from 8 : 30 to 1 . I could show it to you in the evening as well . I guess I can swing $ 21 00 . I 'll check it out . Sounds good . When would you like to come ?
Can I come by and take a look at it ? Sure sounds great . Are you willing to lower the price on it ? I am on a tight budget .
I 've been looking for a car ranging from 2 . 5 K to 4 K . I am looking at a few other cars too . Would 3 K work for you ? I will need 5000 to part ways with this one . But what we can do is that i can get 1000 down from you and the rest can be paid monthly . How about $ 35 00 in cash today . If there are no issues after 3 months , I 'll give you an extra $ 500 ?

Hello .

170 , 000 and such 57 00 is a more than fair price . That 's quite a bit . Are you willing to negotiate for a lower price ? of course . what is your budget like ?
Hi , have you tested these speakers recently ?
Yes they are . I am willing to negotiate . What else would you like to ask ? I am new in the area , are you close to city center ? Yes we are just 5 miles from there . We have beautiful walk ways to that lead out toward the city center .

Hi .
Yes , are you interested ? yes , for $ 2500 . Sorry , I already have a few offers at $ 29 00 . I am going as low as I can .
Hi , are you coming to the open house ?
Well I paid more than that for the two of them , and they really do go very well together . I could go as low as 120 I think , considering you 're a student . My top is $ 110 .. could that work ? I think I could go as low as 115 , that seems fair to both of us ...
I think it sounds too low . How about 27 and you pay for shipping ? I could do 30 but no shipping included . these are brand new and retail for a lot more than 35 .
Hi - so you are interested in my sweet Pri us ?
I could come pick it up if that 's ok . If you can sell it to me for 20 , I will be more than happy to come get it as soon as possible . Ok , when can you get it ? I am free most of the time . When would be good for you ?

Hello , I am interested in your home security system . Great , I 'm asking $ 165 for it . Considering it isn 't the latest model , I think $ 165 is a little unreasonable . I was thinking around $ 80 would be fair .
hi , is the house still available ? It sure is . Were you looking to buy it ?
I like what I see . What do you use it for ? Hello , are you a new person ? I think the other person was disconnected . It 's a bike I used to get to work when my job was close by , I didn 't use it much . Oh Okay , I am looking at the media cabinet for sale for $ 20 . I give you $ 10 and pick it up today .

Is the TV still available ? Hi , yes it is ! i would love for it to end up in your home . have you owned one of these before ? No I have not . I have been wanting one for quite a while .

It is in perfect condition . I bought it brand new 6 years ago . Every single thing on it works perfect . I have over $ 3000 invested in it . Sounds good okay . So how much mileage is on it ? I think it is right around 3000 . It does not get as much use as it should . I had a baby 3 years ago and it has kinda been collecting dust ever since .

yes , it works very well . I have never had any problems with it . Can you do 57 dollars for it . I had to pay a few bills and that 's what I have left . I need this router for my work . let 's call it an even $ 60 and you have a deal .
I have to stick to the 10 999 , but I can throw in a tank of gas and 1 year of sir ius x m radio service ( I will prep ay for it ). I can 't come up with that much money . Would you consider 6 500 with none of the extras ? I can make 10000 work without the extras .
Yes I am open to that . What do you have in mind ? I cant go too low though . I 'm on a strict budget , but would be willing to pay $ 350 . I could also come and get it . I can do 400 last that 's about 150 less than what I am selling it . I think its a fair price .
Absolutely not . We just changed the color and the padding on the chairs . It 's a beautiful little set , great on a sun por ch or outside . Any chance you would be willing to meet halfway for pickup ? If you pick the set up I can sell it for $ 75 .
I 'd like to pay $ 7 for it . I can come and pick it up from your place if that makes it any better . $ 8 . Finally offer . Okay that works for me man , thanks a lot . I can do $ 8 , Ill come pick it up sometime later on today if that works out well for you too .
I might come down a little . What do you have in mind ? Are utilities included ? I 'm afraid not .
That makes sense . I see they are listed for $ 65 but that 's a bit pricey for me . I 'm a college student trying to furnish my first place . Would you be willing to accept $ 20 for them . I 'd even pick them up myself . Being that I recently graduated college I do understand how money can be tight , but unfortunately that is a bit too low for me to part with them . If you are willing to come up some in price , or could throw something else in , we may be able to work something out . How about $ 32 since they do look like they are in pretty good condition ?

Okay sounds great ! Would you be willing to pay the listed price of $ 9 79 ? I would love to negotiate a lower price , as the other apartment that I am looking at is priced at 700 . This one looks much better though . Could you take a lower price ? This is a rather premium apartment , how about i waive the safety deposit for a month and move to 750 ?
Can 't go lower than 1500 , as there is a pool as well as appliances being included in the asking price . I only have 1300 to my name right now , would that be acceptable ? Well that can 't be true if you 're still leasing your current apartment , which includes first and last month payments in your account . I 'm giving the offer at 1400 .
Hello , I have this beautiful home available now . Well , what can you tell me about it ?
Hi , is this still available ?
Would you be willing to pay 1500 a month ? I see that the listing price is only $ 14 87 a month and I felt that was a little steep really .. This is a high quality apartment and high quality apartments don 't come cheap . I 'd be willing to go to 14 50 .
$ 65 and it 's yours . Sorry the most I can do is 50 . I 'm sorry but that is too low . Thank you for your interest .
How many bedrooms are in your single family home ? There are 2 master bedrooms , and one room that could be used as a bedroom but does not have a closet .
I will be willing to go as high as 2000 for a 2 year lease . Sorry , we cannot agree to that term . Ok , well my best offer is 2000 so either take it or leave it . I rather live in a box on a corner then .

Great ! I see you want $ 14 87 , is there any way you can go down on the price a bit ? The price is neg ot iable within reason . My offer is $ 10 40 .

How are you doing today ? Are you interested in the cabinets I 'm selling ?
The price is very high for me and not affordable . Well , make me an offer then . How about $ 37 ?

I 'd like to get $ 600 for the bike . Thanks for selling the bike . I 'm very interested , but I can 't go that high . What price were you thinking ?
Has it been in any accidents ? Any scratches or d ents ? I 've been away at school , no one has really used it except for my grandmother to go to church . All the info is in the Car F ax . Could you take $ 4 200 for it ?
What 's the mileage on it ? It has 135 k miles , mostly highway miles though . I think the mileage is too high for the asking price . Can you negotiate the price at all ?
sorry that is too low , lowest I could do is 2000 and waive half of the deposit . I really like this apartment could you do 1800 and I do some work for you ? I 'm pretty handy . sorry no .

Yes I 'm sure we can work something out as long as you can be reasonable . The bike is really sou ped up and took alot of my time to customize ! I can definitely see that ! Are there any other modifications other than the shocks and saddle ? Yes , the cr anks are updated and also the dro pper . The bike is so fast and so very light , you will love it !
Sure I can work with you on the price a little bit . Okay my budget is around $ 600 how does that sound ? 600 is way too low , look how much the tri ke has , custom sound , al pine speakers , J VC amp , the excellent condition , etc .
How are you .
Thank you . A glass top and bottom and it is adjustable up and down . All for $ 149 . That 's a pretty good price , but I 'm kinda broke right now .

Pretty good , it 's used but it has a lot of add on s . For a used bicycle I w am willing to pay $ 650 . It has FSA V - drive cr anks , Vu elta X RP Pro Super lite wheels , r it che y ch omp handle bars , rock sh ox racing forks and Av id Ju icy 7 Hydra ulic disk brakes . I 'm not going under 700 .
Hello , what 's the gas mileage like ? Hi thanks for your interest , it get around 22 in the city .
If I bring a friend to help move it and vacuum where we move it from , would $ 38 be ok ? I can help you load it in your car or truck . My friend has to come anyway since my car is in the shop . What is the lowest you 'll go on price please ?
How many miles does it have ? How often has it been used off road ? It has been used off road a few times , but not alot ! Has a 125 , 000 miles , so just getting it broke in ! Excellent condition and many extras . Clean title and ready to go . Great . Will you take $ 7 000 for it ?
Hello . Do you still have the bike ? yes . $ 800 seems pretty high for a used bike . Can I get it for $ 600 ?
It 's looks pretty good . Yeah , it 's part of that new generation of smart watches . Perfect , but we want to off - load it because it doesn 't fit on my son 's hands . That 's too bad . I have done some research and these cost about 275 new . Sometimes when they are on sale they are 250 . Since this is a pre - owned item , I would like to pay less than retail . I am sure you can understand where I am coming from . I can bring you cash tonight if you 're willing to take $ 200 .
This is a 3 bedroom and very spacious so it 's worth the money . Oh ok . That makes more sense . Seems like you have a studio also . Tell you what , I could do the three bedroom for 2000 , or two bedroom 1800 . I 'll sign a 1 year lease either way . I can let you get the 3 bedroom for 2100 but that is as low as I can go .
Hello I am interested in the home . Great , this property is newly renovated and has many modern features , it will not last long at this price !

Thanks for viewing my listing .
Hello . Thanks for viewing the listing .
This bike is a great deal as you can see from the description . I feel as though $ 800 is a reasonable asking price considering the high end components . The frame looks great , but I 'm concerned about maintenance costs and more fragile components . Would you be interested if I delivered it to you for free and dropped the price to $ 775 ?
I am . How much has it been used ? It has only been used a handful of times , I just do not get the opportunity to use it like I had hoped I would . Are there any problems with it ? Major scratches or anything ?
h mmm , how old is this bike ? It is from 2009 . That is pretty old . I am thinking for price closer to $ 480 ?
Of course ! It 's a super sp inner ! Made by Curtis ! Well , I 'm not sure I believe all that ... but it is nice to look at ... I could offer you 300 for it , and I could pick it up today ... That would be acceptable , at $ 350 .
What can I help you with ? Are the ut l ities included here ? The utilities are included , and wifi as well . This one does not include parking though , it is available for more .
There is no chair , just the glass desk and a set of draw ers . I have owned it for about one year . Sorry was confused by the picture . Have you used this desk alot ? It was used a little , I bought it thinking I would be able to do some work at home , but then we had our third child , and we need to make the home office a play room . Otherwise , I would be keeping this desk . I loved it . If you can pick up the desk , I w old be willing to sell it for $ 65 .

I would like to go a bit lower 45 ? I can do that if you 're able to meet me today , is that possible ? Yes . I 'm on my way . Thank you sir !
Good day . Hello there . I am interested in the adapters . How much are you willing to sell it for ? They are listed for $ 50 .
Nothing at all . It has never been ridden . That sounds great , would you be willing to negotiate on your price a little bit , I could pay in cash and come by today ? Sure . How much were you thinking ?
It 's in perfect working order , has a 3 way switch , has some wear for it 's age but it 's an awesome table lamp and one that you don 't see everyday . How long have you had it ? Quite awhile now , it 's been at our home as long as I can remember . But it 's reliable and an awesome son ner man lamp .
Since parking isn 't included which will probably cost over 100 because of the great location and utilities cost over 200 dollars a month , I cannot put down more on rent when some things are included . I 'll do 1 125 but that 's the highest I can go . I have to eat too . Let us make the parking charge free of cost for you and final ize this deal for $ 13 00 . Ag ree ? 12 50 and it 's a deal .
Hello . I noticed your ad for the batteries . I need one for my phone , since the battery on my phone is starting to go . I really only needed one battery , but you are the only listing I 've seen so far . Could you consider $ 6 ?
hi ther lets make this deal . Sounds great , you 're looking at a beautiful home here . Do you have any questions ?
How much are you thinking ? $ 90 if possible ! How about $ 130 .

It 's actually a chest - it was my parents , it 's pretty old but not sure if it qualifies as an antique yet ! @ . Yes I can see the photo now . It was a little dark . It is very nice . What is the condition ?
It is garage kept ever since I have owned it . It is top of the line . All new parts and rarely rid en . I would not accept 100 . 00 I would work on my asking price of 1200 . 00 though . I was asking if you would take 1100 not 100 . Sorry I should have been more specific . Sounds lie k a great bike , why are you selling it ? I am just getting to old to ride , and I have no children . I want someone else to enjoy it . I would accept 1100 for the bike , I want someone to own it who wil use it and have fun with it .

The price for the the 2 bed unit , 950 sq ft is $ 1900 . Will you include garbage and water with that ? Yes , do you have good credit and past rental references ?
I would love to have this for my mother , she is very sick and this would help her and with me taking care of her and having to take a leave from work I can pay very much of it . I 'm willing to go down a bit but this thing is pretty good as it is , what were you thinking ? I could go up to $ 110 . 00 and pick it up so you would not have to pack and ship .
Hi . How are you ?
Hi , I am interested in the bike you have for sale , can you tell me a bit about it ... It 's a 20 . 75 inch top tube Fit Bike V H 2 . Very good condition , no rust , but does have a few scratches from use . How old is it ?
Is this item brand new in box ? Yes it is brand new , sealed in retail box still : ). It sounds good , although I do believe the models with recharge able batteries are superior . Coin batteries are often expensive and difficult to find . Will you accept $ 25 ? I can pick up immediately .
I couldn 't come down nearly that low . Car is in great shape , and only 60 k miles . This car is good for at least another 140 k miles , perhaps more with really good care . I could come down to $ 6000 if that helps you . I suppose I could stretch that much in a month or two , but right now the most I can do is $ 55 00 . Cash in hand , you pick up today , I will go to $ 55 00 .
I was thinking closer to 150 would be more fair ... How about $ 160 ? Hmm I don 't think I can go that high ... 150 really is my ceiling ...
Hi , I was wondering if you could take $ 80 . I am buying for a nursing home and can 't afford much . I apologize , but I can 't accept $ 80 , as I was really looking to get $ 100 for it . Would $ 93 work for you ? If we could make it an even $ 90 , we would have a deal .

It is like new and just a few months old . Well , do you happen to know how easy it is to flash dd w rt to the device ? I have no idea . Sorry .
Yes I am . What condition is the bike in ? excellent condition , barely used at all . I see this bike is worth about $ 160 new , so your asking price is too high .
I 'm neat , don 't throw wild parties , non - sm oker , and no pets . I might be able to swing 23 00 , but that 's as high as I can go . You sound like you would make a great tenant . I can meet you in the middle at $ 28 00 , but I honestly can 't go any higher . Can you do $ 26 00 ? As it is , I 'm going to be eating ram en for a while .
Well I certainly appreciate that , but with my income , I 'm unable to afford your asking price , regardless of amenities . What price range are you looking at here ? Ideally , I 'd like to pay $ 1500 per month .
I will not go lower than $ 15 my friend . I can go $ 15 if you are willing to deliver . If was planning on having you come and pick it up 14 and you have a deal . As long as you come pick it up yourself !
I have an old black berry and need a charger . Okay , great ! You came to the right place then . I have 2 of these charg ers that also come with the international power attachments . This is old stuff though . 25 dollars is kind of high . I was looking to spend maybe 10 .
They received maintenance about 6 months ago . Okay . And how old are the brakes and shocks ? They are the same age as the bike so about 2 years old . I 'll throw in the spare tire that I haven 't gotten around to putting on yet if you 're willing to buy the bikes .
Those are included in the listing price . Would you accept an offer of $ 27 60 ? I would accept $ 2 , 850 .

those are miles , man . are they all highway miles ? Yes , mostly . I had a job across the state , so it was my commute car . Oil changes were made religiously every 3 , 000 miles . h m . let see here . 11 year old car , 150 K . I 'll tell you what I can go 2100 for this car .
Hello , I am very interested in your cred enza . Can you tell me more about it ?
Any other used car you find in this price range is going to be a complete rust bucket . This car is fully functional , and the AC even still works . I know with all the increased flooding all over the US due to climate change there are a lot of very damaged cars being sold right now . Could you provide a car fax report to make sure no damage has been reported on this car ? I can definitely do that for you . What 's your offer ?
Hi .
Hello .
It 's in good condition . It has always been stored indoors , so no rust or ch ipping . Are the tires in good condition ? I see they are original ones . They are the original , but to be honest , I never rode it very often . There is still a good amount of tread on them , so there 's many more miles to go before they 'll need to be replaced .
hi , i saw your note about this listing . are you still interested ? sorry i couldn 't contact earlier .
Ah , I didn 't know about the brakes ! That makes a big difference for me . I 'm willing to pay $ 650 , in cash if you 'd prefer , and pick it up myself . $ 690 and it is yours . Are you willing to go just a bit lower , perhaps $ 675 ?

Yeah but the price is holding me back . Did you see how it has the lower shelf for additional storage ? yes I did and am very much interested . The question is , are you going to accept $ 84 for it ?
What about cable is that included ? Utilities are not included , but I can give you a small discount in rent if that will help . How does $ 27 00 sound instead ? What about trash service ?
Hi there . I w would love to buy your mirrored night stand . can you please tell me more about it ? Sure . It 's almost 26 inches in height and just over 20 inches wide . It has 3 draw ers and is mirrored on all sides .
HI . Yes I am . How old is it ? Not sure , but it looks like new . Any other questions ? Only other question is , is it in a decent neighborhood ?
What is the security deposit ? there is a 1 month security deposit . Would you be willing to accept half a month security deposit the first month and half the second month ?
If we can meet in the middle at $ 80 we have a deal . $ 75 is the highest I can go at this time . deal .
Awesome ! Does anything come with it ? Charg er , case , etc ? Yes , a charger , and 2 cases one blue one pink , they are the kind that enc ase the phone . I 'm good with $ 150 , how will I receive the phone ? Pick up , mail , or meeting ?

That sounds great . I am familiar with the listing , I am willing to pay you $ 800 for the rental . I am sorry , but that offer is far lower than I can accept . this is a prime location so the best I can do is $ 1 , 500 . Based on the size of the apartment , I think that rice is very unreasonable . I recently saw a similar apartment for $ 900 . The max I can pay for this a par ment in $ 1000 .
96 is a bit below what I 'm comfortable with accepting . Tell you what . 120 and I 'll throw in this very cool light bulb I found for it . Ah no need for a light bulb I intend to use a dynamic color changing Phillips led in it . G onna go great for setting up an intimate mood with my special someone . Well that 's ok but I still can 't go under 120 . It 's already a 40 dollar drop so I think it 's very fair .
A few minor ones , nothing major I would not even say normal wear and tear and I only rode it a few times . How long have you had it ? I bought it last year .
I 'm interested in the matt res if it 's still for sale ,. Yes it 's still for sale . Me and my girlfriend are in the process of moving so we 're just trying to get rid of it . Got cha , so I see that it 's a full , does it have any tears or stains ?
I bought it new a little less than 2 years ago . does the wood have any scars or scratches ? None at all it is in very good shape .
H mmm , that 's a bit high for me . Would you be willing to go lower if I came by to pick it up myself ? I could come down a little , what were you thinking ? How about 35 ?
Hello , I am interested in these apartments , the price is awfully high , though . Does it include free laundry facilities ? there is both laundry facilities on site and a laundry conc ier ge service . OK , can it be guaranteed that I get one of the upgraded apartments ?
Good evening , are you interested in this really nice glass office desk ? Yes , very interested . How long have you owned this chair ? There is no chair , just the glass desk and a set of draw ers . I have owned it for about one year .

Nice , well it only has around 120 k miles , all the amenities , so those are great , and I have the title . What 's your budget ? I 'd like to spend as little as possible . Has it ever been in a accident ? A minor f ender - bender , but it 's since been repaired , so it 's un notice able . The Blue book value on this car is 10 k .
Our two bedroom units are priced at $ 2 , 300 . It includes the heat , water and garbage . These apartments have great floor plans with walk - in pant ry and all new appliances . Would you like to come take a tour ? I would love to come take a tour . I am just concerned that $ 2 , 300 might be a little too steep for me to afford right now . I am a landsc aper by trade . Is there anyway I would be able to provide my landsc aping services for Garden Village Apart ments in return for getting the apartment at $ 2 , 000 ? I do really nice work ! We have a contract with our own landsc aping company . We can offer you $ 100 discount per month if you sign a 12 months lease , providing that your application is approved . I think you will be impressed with our property and all the amenities that we offer .

I am flexible . I only have $ 45 in cash and dont get paid for a week so I cant get any more out of the bank until then and need the st ools for a party tomorrow . Any chance you can do 45 hom ie ? seriously ?
Hello ! Do you have any questions about the Pri us ? How many miles does it have on it ? You say " had backup camera " does it work ? There are 180 , 000 miles on the car , mainly highway . It is a good runner . It does have a backup camera , but only works when it wants to . I don 't use it often so I never got it looked at for repair .
I see your point but I can go down to 32 50 , you 'll live the place , it ' fully remod eled so it feels like a brand new home . Of course I 'll need to come take a look at the place first , but , I 'll take the offer of 32 50 . Deal . ok I ll bake a cake and we can discuss the contract over some coffee and cake , can you make it tomorrow at 4 pm ?

D ang .. I am forced to move away from my old place because I can 't afford it at 13 25 ... I was hoping to pay something more like 800 - 1000 . Is that at all possible ? $ 1 , 000 is a bit low , If you could make a one bedroom work I could do $ 1 , 200 w / one month free . Hmm that might work for me . The one bedroom will defin ately take some adjustment for me but I think that is the way I will have to go , I will go that way ... but is there any way to shave a little more off of that 1200 ?
hi . Hi , this is interesting I 've never seen equipment like this before . Is it lightweight ?
There is nothing wrong it is in great condition . Ok .. I can come and get it now with $ 77 cash in hand . The lowest I can go for this would be $ 85 . Are you able to do that ?
It 's in good condition . The paint does have some scratches and the pedal are pretty worn . Other then that it 's in nice shape . Great , It will be just fine for him . I would like to ask if you would be willing to go down on price . Maybe $ 150 . I can do $ 175 .
ye s it 's a very nice wood and convert 's to a smaller table it 's hand crafted artisan wood work design i 'm asking $ 400 . I am very interested but I would like to offer $ 250 since it is not new . I have cash in hand and can pick up today . i can 't let it go that cheap i paid much more than 400 i can deal with 300 .
That 's a very sweet bike ! Yes , it has brought me a lot of good times . I 'm asking $ 17 00 for it . Why are you parting with it ?
Yes could you tell me any details about it ? it is 51 " Plasma TV , I ve had it for about 6 months Im sadd en by the fact that I have to sell it . I see so it works fine without any issues ?

No , there 's nothing wrong with it . We 've been very easy about using it . Maybe there 's a few sc uffs on the legs , but that should be normal . Okay great . Can i have it for $ 200 cash payment . I will pick it up myself . I would be glad if you came to pick it up ! Though , $ 200 seems a little low for me . Would you be willing to do 265 ?
I 'm fabulous ! Are you interested in the chair ? Yes I am . Could u tell me more about it ? Are you the org inal owner ? Smoke free home ? Any damage , tears or marks ? Sure . I purchased the chair 6 months ago . It 's still in great condition , clean and free from wear and tear . We have a pet and smoke - free home .
I know your price is firm , but I am a college student , trying to make ends meet , and need this item , but at a lower price . Are you willing to lower just a few dollars to $ 59 ? I know almost nothing about this stuff . My brother - in - law does computers and he said I should sell it for 80 . My wife would kill me if I go below 65 . Can you get a L ITT LE closer ? 63 maybe ?
Check ing out the awesome bike , huh ? Do you have any questions ? Yes , are you including the big bike with the trailer thing or is it separate ?
$ 2 172 . Hmm , I was expecting something less than that . Are utilities included ? Yes they are . I am willing to negotiate . What else would you like to ask ?
ican give a extra 10 $ additional discount . that would be nice . how about the shipping ? it includes . can we have the deal .
I was hoping to get 60 dollars for it . It is in good condition and the tires are almost brand new . I understand that . However , I do see that I 'll need to replace the chain and put air in the tires , so that 's a bit of a disadvantage to me . How about $ 50 ? 50 dollars might work . I can only accept cash payments though , Is that alright with you ?
Excellent . Based on the condition and age , it 's a little higher than I 'm looking to pay . Would you accept $ 14 for it ? I can 't go as low as $ 14 , but could you do $ 18 ? That 's still a little steep . How about $ 16 ?

Hi ! Yes , is it in good condition ? It is ! It 's about a year old . It was in our son 's room and he left for college . We are clearing out to make it a more formal guest room . That 's great . Is it comfortable to sit on and watch TV ? What size is it ?
I was thinking more of $ 45 . How about we split the difference and go $ 50 each ? That is do able I could deliver them too you for the extra five though . Let 's do $ 55 , that way you have to deliver them . We got a deal ! Thanks !
50 K miles . For only $ 3000 ? Really ? Yes , are you interested ?
It 's for the trailer part . It attaches to your own bike ( collar included ) to help teach your kids how to shift . It looks pretty cool but I see that it has a bit of wear . How would you feel about accepting $ 50 for it ? Well , that 's proof that it 's done its job ! We could do $ 75 , I could throw in a good scrub down , the Warriors flag , and even deliver it for you . : - ).

Hey if I pay for my own utilities , will you take $ 14 00 a month ? That 's a little low , it 's in an upper scale area and worth a bit more than that . Ok how about 1900 ?

Hello . Thanks for viewing the listing . Nice truck . How many miles on it ?
it actually still has over 10 months of the warranty that comes with the bike when you buy it . I will not go as low as 150 . I can do 225 though . Usually a warranty doesn 't transfer if you sell it . I can do 200 . if you have any problems with it , within the next 10 months save my number . I can do 200 . you will pick up tonight ?
I would like to buy your vol vo x c 90 . the price is 4 500 . It is a good car with no issues .
High ceilings , sounds like expensive heating / cool ing bill ... Actually , while this home does have ceiling fans and A / C this home brings not only comfort BUT is energy efficient as well . You 're wasting my time man ... do you want to sell this or not ...
Would you be willing to pay 1500 a month ? I see that the listing price is only $ 14 87 a month and I felt that was a little steep really ..
They are the same age as the bike so about 2 years old . I 'll throw in the spare tire that I haven 't gotten around to putting on yet if you 're willing to buy the bikes . Sure , would you take $ 45 for them >. I 'd be open to going down to $ 60 including the additional tire .
Does it have any scratches ? It has a couple of tiny d ings but only when you look at it very closely . Hmm . what type fo wood is this unit ?
Well it does have a lot of miles on it , can we bring it down to 49 00 . It does , so I am willing to negotiate more . I can throw in the d ually bed with the truck , for $ 6000 . I would like that , but can we bring the price down further , considering you need it gone and I need a truck . how about 5 500 .

Yes . Awesome , I like the bed but it is a little expensive for me . Can you lower the price ? Well , they 're bunk beds . You are getting two matt resses and the frame for only $ 290 . If you pay my asking price I could throw in two pill ows for free .
Hello , I have this beautiful home available now .
It is a very reliable car . It does have higher miles , however Toyota 's are very well known for lasting . I 'm not able to accept $ 2 , 100 , that is too low , less than half of what I 'm asking . I need something reliable . It does have a lot of miles on it . Mostly highway though . Would you accept 2100 ? I will need to have some work done on it , it sounds like . Maybe an electrical problem somewhere . Its for my daughter , she 's going to college next month . How old are the tires ?
Hello , I was wondering about the table you have for sale .
You still have the BM X Bike ? Yes , still have it for sale . Good , I am interested . I see it has a lot of perks and you are asking $ 425 , but that is a bit over my budget . Will you take $ 297 for it ?
i did not see that it had a 2 car garage . That is great . It seems perfect for my small family of 3 . They will love this place . It has a built - in security system too . You will love the master bedroom . Do we have a deal at $ 2 , 600 ? My budget is max ed out at $ 24 50 . 00 . Will you accept that offer .

If you pick it up and cash only I could drop it to $ 185 lowest as I am moving . It would help me as well . How about $ 155 and I can come pick it up right now ? That is too low for me , $ 185 is the best I can do .
I was hoping to get closer to 150 for the bike but I can go down a little if you 're willing . How does 125 sound to you and I can throw in some stuff like a seat cover and bike lock for you ? $ 100 maybe ? I don 't need that extra stuff . I just need to get it for my kid . I see , okay I am willing to let it go for 100 , thank you .

Hi ! I 'm interested in your bike . Great ! It 's a nice mountain bike . I am asking $ 150 .
I don 't know if I could come up to that . They nice but I was hoping to keep it under $ 300 . They are worth it and if we could get them out by this weekend and I know there going to a good home I would do 300 but no lower . I can agree to $ 300 but you have to help me load them in to the truck .
Hello . HI ! I am interested in your listing . I have to be honest with you before we even get started , I am working with a very small budget . I wouldn 't be able to meet the list price and I would probably have to get the price down to as close to $ 18 50 as possible . Is there any way we could negotiate the price ?

G ees h , man , 2400 is a lot of money every month ... how many bedrooms is this ? This is a 3 bedroom and very spacious so it 's worth the money . Oh ok . That makes more sense .

Would you be able to take 50 for them ? That price is too low for me , they are in excellent condition so the listed price is already a good deal . I know it 's just a tight budget I have right now . I 'd be able to go up to $ 58 if that 's possible .
We do all the repairs and maintenance as a part of the lease . You are responsible of keeping the landscape according to H OA guidelines . Ok , how much are you asking ? It is $ 25 99 a month .
Nothing is wrong with the bike at all . I have gotten a bit bigger and I am not riding it as much . I need money to save up for a new one that will fit me . Do you think this would be good for a person who is around 5 ' 5 "? Oh yes ! It would definitely be perfect for someone of that stature . It 's an absolutely amazing bike that has not done me wrong yet .
Hi how are you ?
that 's half of what I am actually asking . Sorry can 't go so low . Its a very unique piece and its an old ie so definitely the amount doesn 't justify that . I can accept $ 100 . As it is a timeless peace , I will go with $ 100 . I am not sure I could find it for better . thanks ! I will take the deal . Great !
Well I have already taken quite a bit off what it is worth in consideration of the work it will need . If you are willing to come get it right away I can guess I could let you have it for $ 55 because as I said I am rather firm on the price . I 'll come get it for $ 42 because I need to give my friend with the truck some gas money . I guess I can do that but you have to come right away ok ?
Hey there ! Are you looking to buy this awesome European style pull out sofa bed ? I 'm not sure . Is it very sturdy and is the mattress included with it ? yes it comes with the mattress .

Would you be willing to negotiate with me on the price ? Yes I am open to that . What do you have in mind ? I cant go too low though . I 'm on a strict budget , but would be willing to pay $ 350 . I could also come and get it .

It is in pretty good shape , everything is pretty sound on her . How about 4 k ? I could probably do $ 4000 . Can you deliver ? That sounds reasonable for a 2007 . Would you be willing to accept a lower offer ? Say 35 00 ?
Awesome . If I signed a 2 year lease could we work out the price a little bit ? I 'm willing to move in as ap and pay $ 2 160 a month . $ 2 160 . 00 won 't be possible at this time . I can lower the rent to $ 22 50 . 00 a month but that 's the lowest I can go . Ok I can do $ 22 50 a month . Thank you .

Hello I am interested in the property , Id love to hear about and special features or details that were not included in the listing . Well , it is a great place ! Single family , great schools in the neighborhood . If I wanted the property would you be willing to partition one of the rooms ?

Would that be an additional feel ; all I have to offer is about $ 58 50 . no additional fee for the warranty but I would need to get close to my asking price with the warranty . I would be willing to accept $ 63 00 . Beyond the listed is there anything else that would come with the car like perhaps an alarm system ?

We have massive soaking tub s , water saving shower heads , and high speed internet that will keep those precious kid Os happy all day ! I can do that ! outstanding ! $ 29 00 it is !

Just one or two minor scratches . That is all . How does $ 1200 sound for it ? That is way out of the ballpark I was asking for , The lowest I would be willing to go currently would be around $ 1500 .
Wow the mattress of my dreams . It really is ! You will never want to get out of bed . I 'm not sure I can buy it then how will I ever get to work .
i can offer you $ 5000 . This is a top of the line car with all of the bells and whist les - roof rack , sun ro of , GPS , backup camera , premium sound system . It 's ready to go . I 'll go to $ 7 000 . i can scrap up $ 57 00 finale offer .
it indeed is a very beautiful house . and in a nice place . True , I can see that . Although I am nervous the upstairs laundry could cause some issues due to the constant knocking sound L aund ry makes when running . not more than it does at any other house .
Does it have any scratches on it ? It 's heavily scratched , but a little paint could fix that up . It has a tire gauge and is light . I can do $ 130 . I could give you $ 120 .
Well , it 's in very good condition , it was used in my office for only a short period of time . It 's practically brand new . does it work with any phone ? It should work with any standard telephone , yes .
How old is the bike . Hi , 2 years old , but after a full tune up I could say it is like new . What age would you recommend for this bike .
However , $ 50 seems way too high for this item . It only has 3 microphones . The newer models have 5 ! Would you take $ 25 ? How about $ 30 ? How about $ 27 and I 'll come pick it up myself !

I can do $ 1 , 500 if you include the parking fees . I think that 's acceptable for both of us , we can go ahead and submit this offer if that 's alright with you ? That sounds good to me .
Hi how are you ! Hey ! I like your place you have there . Hi how are you ! it 's in a great location with a 2 car garage , security system and full size was her and dry er . I 'm asking 2600 / mo for it .
They are listed for $ 50 . Yeah but its way too high for me is there a way we can work it out ? Do you only want the adapters ?
Of course when is a good time and date for you i am completely open ? How about tomorrow at 12 noon ? Perfect .
Yes I sure do . Okay how does it run ? Any problems with it ? and how old is it ? It is in perfect condition . I bought it brand new 6 years ago . Every single thing on it works perfect . I have over $ 3000 invested in it .
yes , it is a plug in hybrid . Great now that mileage , well I would like to get it off your hands and I would have to worry about any future maintain ce concerns so in consideration I would like to offer $ 95 00 . the car both interior and exterior is in excellent condition . only driven by me ( a neat freak ) and i can guarantee that you will feel like you just bought a brand new car . but , i do understand your concern about the mileage and would be willing to take 2000 off the listed price .
$ 225 is a little too low . Would you be willing to go up to $ 250 if I deliver the cabinet to you ? I don 't really need delivery . I can give you $ 230 and be at your doorstep in 15 minutes . $ 230 is agreeable to me . Sounds like a deal !
I have an interest in this apartment .

If you would deliver it to me I would be willing to to pay $ 325 . I can deliver this weekend ? Yes you would del iever it this weekend .
I can do $ 60 for this one . I could get it today with cash in hand . If we can meet in the middle at $ 80 we have a deal . $ 75 is the highest I can go at this time .
hello what 's the mileage on the vol vo ? 14 0000 . ok and when was it serv iced ?
Do you have a vehicle to come and pick it up ? Yes absolutely . I can do that . If you can bring $ 625 cash I 'll do it .
Well it 's a kids trail bike . And it 's an easy bike to shift , so they can learn . What age group would you think appropriate for the kids ? My son is 10 , and he has used it for two years . So I would say anywhere from 9 - 12 .
You know , I am not certain of the exact measurements . I will say that it is spacious . Sorry I mean how many bedrooms how many bathrooms ? It varies . Usually one bathroom , and there are several that have one , two , or three bedrooms . You are more than welcome to come down and tour the complex .
I thought you said it was a minor f ender b ender ? How much work was done on it from the accident . And what type of add - ons ? Like from the original purchase price , if I were to give it to you for 5 k , that 's the cost of a Y aris with no camera , g ps navigation , and the couple hundred dollars I sunk into getting the f ender b ender professionally fixed . Oh , it has a camera ? Is that a back - up camera ?
The phone is about a year old . Sounds good . Do you know if it has ever been submerged in water ? It has not had any water damage at all . The phone is in like new condition .

As a fan of Paw Patrol myself I can give you a better deal but $ 5 is too low . How about $ 10 and you come pick it up from my house ? Does it have a remote ? Yes it comes with the remote and it even has fresh batteries .
55 bucks is the absolute max I can go . I can 't do $ 55 . Sorry . okay .
I can offer you $ 495 for it . h mmm , I can go down to $ 540 and throw in delivery . okay that 's nice ! I would love to have it delivered so I can do $ 540 .
I am great ! I 'm very much interested in your for d f iesta ! are there any issues ? Glad to hear it . No issues with my car . In fact it has every option that was available at the time I purchased it . I 'm just looking for something bigger right now which is why I 'm selling it . I would really love this car , but it seems to be priced a bit high . are you willing to go a bit lower ?
Okay . I 'm interested in buying it . lol . Lol okay . What kind of offer are you wanting to make ? Well , given it 's a 1080 p and they go $ 400 new . I 'll pay $ 350 .
It is ! It 's a great place . Small and quiet and very spacious . What are the schools like ? Are there any kid friendly areas , such as parks , in the area ? The schools are great . The elementary school is 3 blocks away . A few playground s and there is common area outside the unit .
It 's definitely an attractive place , but it 's one of several I 'm looking at . I 've seen similar ads priced as low at $ 1500 . That may be , but this house has 4 bedrooms , 2 bathrooms and a 2 car garage . It also comes with a was her / dry er / d ish washer / st ove and oven , and has a large patio and backyard . The yard is also m owed and maintained by my associate , so you never have to worry about doing yard work . O oh , I like the sound of that . Yard work is a pain . How about $ 2000 , and I 'll sign a 2 year lease . Anything more than that is really out of my price range .

Hi is the apartment still available ? Hi there ! Yes , the apartment is still available and for sale , are you interested ? Yes I am interested does the price include utilities ?
Yes I can lower it down a bit . How low would you be comfortable with ? I 'm shooting for $ 15 75 but I have some w iggle room . Maybe a longer lease would make it easier for you to lower the rent ?

Okay does it come with anything and how long have you had it ? I 've had it for about a year and I have a few smaller accessories to throw in with it : cup holder , bell , lock , new set of tubes . Could you come down on the price at all my budget is around $ 100 what can you do for me ?

Oh , lovely . And there aren 't any scratches on the wood ? Draw ers function correctly ? No scratches , just one ring on the top of the cabinet . All doors work great and the secret drawer functions perfectly . Great . Would you be willing to take $ 225 ? I can pick it up within an hour !

Cool , did you have any questions about the car ? Yes , has it been in any major accidents or had any major failures of the engine etc ? No major accidents or failures of any of the systems . It 's in great shape . It 's got a lot of upgrades and it 's in really good shape . It runs sn ooth and quiet and is very reliable .
what would you say is its most prominent feature . The wood burning fireplace in the living room is lovely in the winter nights . So cozy to sit by and relax after a long day ! sounds very nice . I like the picture . Me and my husband are looking for a place and this seems to be the one . I see you are asking 33 00 . Would you be able to go lower \.
Hello , I am interested in the house . can you give me some more details about it ? Sure , it 's a large 3 bedroom . It 's available June 12 th . Okay , well i am interested but 4000 is too expensive for my budget , especially when there is only 1 bath . Ideally , I would like to pay 28 00 for it .
$ 121 is reasonable and I can understand , you have a point . I can cut you a deal . amazing thanks ! no problem .
Hey great chair for a great price . If you 're selling i 'm buying , what do you say , 540 ? Could you go to 5 90 . I am willing to deliver the hair to you .

Hey there , interested in a Tri k ke ?
I think $ 100 . 00 is more reasonable since it is like new condition . It is a phone and there are no other perks available . They 're selling for $ 210 on Amazon without the Sim Card . I 'll take $ 150 to get a deal done now , but otherwise I 'm not in a hurry to sell . What do you think ? This Apple iPhone is not new . There is no case offered and I need a warranty or assurance that it will continue to work . My offer is $ 120 . 00 . I think this is a very reasonable deal .

Hello , I am willing to sell this for 200 , it is basically brand new . What is the color ? Will you take less ? It is sued e .
Ok well I am looking to spend only $ 35 since it 's a phone that can 't be used other than for parts . well the case by itself is probably worth $ 25 so can you do $ 45 ? I could do $ 40 and pick it up today .
Sure . It is a b ist ro ( extra tall ) table , with two stool height chairs . But the table is big enough that if you wanted to add two more chairs it would be comfortable for 4 to d ine . That seems like what I am looking for . I would be willing to offer you $ 75 dollars for the set ! No , I 'm sorry , I can 't go anywhere near that low . This is a high end set in excellent condition . I 'm only selling it because I wanted something that would seat 6 .
Yeah , I 'm looking to find a good 2 nd car for my house , one that gets good gas mileage . This gets over 40 miles to a gallon , so it is very cost effective . I like that -- you never know what the gas prices will do . When is the last time it had a tune up ?
Hello , I am interested in your home security system .
Hi , I am very interested in the couch . Does it have any tears or stains ?

Great . Would you be willing to take $ 225 ? I can pick it up within an hour ! $ 225 is a little too low . Would you be willing to go up to $ 250 if I deliver the cabinet to you ? I don 't really need delivery . I can give you $ 230 and be at your doorstep in 15 minutes .
That is a little low , I have many people that are interested in the rental . But if you are willing to sign a 2 year lease , I can do $ 3 200 per month . I 'm neat , don 't throw wild parties , non - sm oker , and no pets . I might be able to swing 23 00 , but that 's as high as I can go . You sound like you would make a great tenant . I can meet you in the middle at $ 28 00 , but I honestly can 't go any higher .

Hi -- I 'm interested in the Lewis Ap artment Communities and would like to know more . Sure , any questions that you have in particular ? How big are the studios ?

Well at 130 k miles and being from 1999 I feel that 2500 sounds a bit better . I wasn 't willing to go that low . I did install a new cd player with blu etooth , a d vd player and it has H ID head lings .
The mattress 's are Se aly Post ure ped ic . I think the beds brand name is Ashley furniture . What year was it purchased ? It was purchased in 2012 .

Hi , I 'm interested in buying this bike . Can you tell me what the upgrades are ?
Would you be able to come down on price at all ? Would you be able to do $ 385 ? Man that 's awful low . It is in good vintage condition . And the going rate is much higher among vintage furniture collectors . How about 525 ? I could do $ 525 if you could deliver it ?
$ 4000 Is the asking price , I can assure you it is worth well over that . I think 4000 is a little high for a house with no appliances . I was looking more at 2 200 . The work we have put into the house is worth alot more than the asking price as is ... I suppose I could agree to have appliances installed for you if you are willing to give me at least $ 35 00 .
Would you like to buy this truck ?
It 's neg ot iable since it does have some minor damage from everyday use . I am willing to give you $ 37 for it right now . I 'm sorry , I can 't part with it for that price . Could you possibly do $ 60 ?
are you interested in the rug ?
Thank you for your interest in my beautiful table .
6 months . Wow , so it is practically a new phone . Would you be willing to meet me at the AT & T store to make sure there are no problems ? sure , what 's your offer if everything checks out ?

I 'll come get it for $ 42 because I need to give my friend with the truck some gas money .

the price is 4 500 . It is a good car with no issues . 4 500 is a bit steep for a 2004 model , I would be more interested at a price point near $ 2000 . Sorry I can 't go that low . I would consider coming down to $ 4000 but no lower .
it 's a steal at 35 00 bucks . you won 't see this deal again . Really ? The previous ad is for a 2012 for $ 3000 and it has all the same features plus lists new brakes and tires . Also , according to Blue Book it is only wor h 1500 . toy ota 's and h ond as don 't go by k bb . they last forever . and this car was maintained meticulously . that previous ad might have a salvage title . this is a clean title . no d ings , no defects of any kind . and all power .
180 , 000 miles , but it still runs great ! Great . Any other problems I should know about ? There was a hit on the front left f ender awhile ago , but it 's been repaired .
How about $ 180 . no way no way I can agree for 160 . How about we split the difference and do $ 170 .
I am very interested but that price is a bit high . What condition is th e bike in . It 's in good condition . It has always been stored indoors , so no rust or ch ipping . Are the tires in good condition ? I see they are original ones .
Ok I will give you 80 for it right now I can get if for a penny less then what you are asking at best buy right now . 130 and I will throw in the $ 30 case with it . I actually have a ton of cases for this phone , this is a replacement for a broken one . I could do $ 100 .
I lost my ear plugs from my  iph one and would love a new pair . I saw your ad but 5 dollars is a bit steep . Would you consider 2 dollars ? Considering that it is new and I am handling the shipping I would think $ 5 is a very good price .

Hello . I have listed this item for $ 12 . You said you 'd be willing to lower the price in the listing -- would you take 4 dollars ? I can 't go quite that low - sorry . How about $ 9 ?
How long have you had it ? I bought it last year . Ok . Well since I 'm buying it as a gift for my son , I might need to change the pe gs so it might be an additional cost for me in it . Would you be willing to lower the price for me ?
Hello , yes it is . Were you interested ? I am interested . I notice you say had backup camera . Does it work ? Yes it does .
That sounds like a great offer , but its below the listing price and that is without the partition . How about 36 50 ? You make a fair point , and drive a hard bargain , but I accept . Great ! Anything else that you need with it ?
I am interested in your speaker are you able to negotiate with me ? Yes It is Brand New In the box ! Is it pretty nice and loud ?

Yes they are but the studios are around the same size as the 2 bed 2 bath apartments and the studios have balcony access and special parking permits . Wow that is a big studio . Well as I said I was trying to stay around 400 I could do 550 since it does include util ites . If you can work with that price I will even sign a 2 year lease . Okay I can $ 550 if you sign the 2 year lease and agree to move in by the end of this month .
Does the $ 50 include delivery ? No . Would you take less than $ 50 if I pick it up ?
Yes , I 've never altered it in any way . okay sounds good , could you take $ 490 ? I can 't go lower than at least $ 510 .
They are in excellent condition as they haven 't been used a lot . The mattress 's are like new . Was it new when you bought it ? Yes , the bed 's and mattress was brought brand new . They were for my grand kids to use while visiting .
Are you able to come pick it up ? Yes . I can come get today . Okay . I 'll do $ 29 and you can pick it up this morning .

Sounds good okay . So how much mileage is on it ? I think it is right around 3000 . It does not get as much use as it should . I had a baby 3 years ago and it has kinda been collecting dust ever since . Nice . Can you work with me on the price any ? I 've got about 1100 .

Do you think this would be good for a person who is around 5 ' 5 "? Oh yes ! It would definitely be perfect for someone of that stature . It 's an absolutely amazing bike that has not done me wrong yet . Awesome . I 'd like to offer you 380 for it .
Hello , I 'm interested in your bike that you have listed . Can you tell me more about it ?
Way too low ! 35 00 ? The Kelley Blue Book value is 47 00 . I am looking to sell on my own because it benefits me and the buyer .
Nice , and good to know . The wear on this isn 't like gar ish scratches , just light disc ol oration - I think it makes it look a bit home ly , personally . h mm . I like it still but is it the original var n ish ?
How old is it ? I just bought it a month ago . I haven 't even taken it out of the box ! But I found out I 'm getting transferred , so decided to sell it . I would love to pick it up today , but the price is a little out of my budget . can you come lower ?
I just can 't afford that . Are the tires new ? Is there a sun ro of ? If yes , I will come up with 7 500 tops . That is a deal or no deal price for me . I can 't do that . But based on the year your local credit union would issue you a small loan for the balance . It is new enough to still qualify for new car rates . True . I really want the car . If it has low mileage , a sun ro of and new tires , would you take 9000 ?
Hi there ! I see your listing and it looks like it 's a good fit . What can you tell me about this place ?
Hello . Do you still have the bike ?

Hi are you interested ?
Who a . Pretty cute table there .
Yes , I am interested in the home you have available . Well I am offering 33 00 for it per month for a 1 year lease . I am interested , and that is in the area I would like to be , but would you be willing to consider an offer of $ 23 50 per month ?
I know you 'll love it here ! I hope so . Please submit your offer of 2500 in the Final Agreement box .
You still have the BM X Bike ?
The battery on my phone is starting to not last very long before I need to recharge it and I 'm thinking I might need to get a new one . I saw your listing but other listings are going for less . Can you take $ 7 for it ? That 's all I can come up with now .
i really dont have that much to spend i would be able to afford $ 89 . The table is priced at $ 149 . I am willing to negotiate but $ 89 is too low . how about 120 .

Wow I really want this but my budget is not quite there . Do you have any room on the price ? I would be able to buy it today if I can get the price down .
I have a side question are you doing this hit multiple times go get 55 cent each time ? Or only once ?
Hey there , id love to buy your couch , what can you tell me about it ? What price are you looking for , and is it in really good condition , or very used ? Hello ! As king price is $ 700 . It is in excellent condition . It was in our finished basement and barely used . Alright , well I was trying to buy it for around $ 350 , but since its in good condition Ill go higher . If it comes washed and you can deliver it to my place I would be able to do $ 650 , would that work for you ?
Hello , is the camera still available ? yes , I still have it . I 'm interested in it and I would like to offer $ 35 . I 'm not trying to be a low - ball er , I 'm just on a tight budget . And yes , I like wine and whiskey !
Hi I have this beautiful bunk bed for $ 290 and I have thrown in a mattress for you .
Just 2 years old and works very fine . Would you happen to know if it has working cartridges or if I have to get new ones ? Yes it does . Actually i just bought 2 new ink cartridges . One already installed in the printer and one as spare . These are complimentary to the sale .
Will you include garbage and water with that ? Yes , do you have good credit and past rental references ? Yes , I have all of that .
I am interested in buying all four . Could we get it down to 175 for all 4 ? I can 't go lower than $ 50 . That 's already almost 30 % off on each . I am willing to deliver them to you , though . So you can deliver all four to me at $ 200 total ? I will agree to that !

Fair enough , I am just on a budget and the rent is rather high . Are you willing to come down in price ? Yes , since this unit does not have laundry hook - up it would be reasonable to lower the asking price . What price were you thinking might work better for you ? I was hoping closer to $ 1000 .
there are a few d ents to the ledge but not that bad . Ok . Are they very noticeable ? no at all .
Yeah that 's quite a bit under my asking price . I could go $ 75 but it 's in really good condition and a cool bike to own . I was hoping for a little lower , just because it 's on the older end . I don 't have a ton to spend . How about 55 $ ? How about $ 65 ?
Oh , that sounds great . Do you accept pets ? Are there any kind of fees for them ? We do accept pets . only small pets and there is a one time fee of $ 300 . We have a no smoking policy . That 's good , ours is only a mini . Are there any utilities included in the monthly rent ?
There are 180 , 000 miles on the car , mainly highway . It is a good runner . It does have a backup camera , but only works when it wants to . I don 't use it often so I never got it looked at for repair . How many miles does it have on it ? You say " had backup camera " does it work ? I need something reliable . It does have a lot of miles on it . Mostly highway though . Would you accept 2100 ?
Well I am selling it for $ 18 95 . The lowest I can go is $ 1600 . Is it move in ready ? Are any amenities included with property ? Yes its move in ready and we can discuss more about it when we meet on m onday if you will .
Hello .
It says in the ad that your grandfather passed away " a couple of years ago ." I 'm sorry for your loss by the way . I want vintage but I want vintage that works . How about I pay 75 , and I 'll take them as is , no questions asked . 75 sounds good . You can test them out for yourself . I am sure that they still work fine . We have a deal .

It 's in perfect condition ! I 've only had it for a few years . It 's from a non - smoking / non - pet home . I 'm only selling because I 'm moving and can 't take it with me . Okay , Will you deliver or must I pick up ? I can deliver if you 're willing to pay full price of $ 600 . Will that work for you ?
Yes , very interested . How long have you owned this chair ? There is no chair , just the glass desk and a set of draw ers . I have owned it for about one year . Sorry was confused by the picture . Have you used this desk alot ?
I 'm interested in the studio . Awesome . It is still available for $ 1900 .
Hey there , nice bike you got . Looking for a cheap bike for my k idd o . This is definitely a perfect one ! Not cheap , but a classic !
No , it does not . Is this item used ? No , it is new in the box .
If you come up to 9 500 we have a deal . I can 't . I 've reached my upper limit . Will it be cash in hand if I say yes ?
That is good . The phone is black and has a gold case currently . Any d ents or wear ? No , It is in great condition with no scratches .
It 's a little too big for me as well . I am 5 ' 11 " and will use it lightly to get from point A to B . I don 't think $ 800 is enough for a 24 lb aluminum bike , especially one from 8 years ago . I understand your point I willing to take $ 700 for it . Would you go any lower if I go and pick it up myself ?

Does it come with all the cables and paperwork ? Yes it does . Okay , great ! I am very interested in it . Are you willing to come down any on the price ? I would be willing to meet today with cash in hand .
Great . Do you have any experience with these tooth br ushes ? I 've never had an electric one . Does it have good reviews ? I personally use this tooth brush that was recommended by my dentist and I be le ive it gives me a better cleaning than my manual tooth brush . Sounds nice . I think you have it priced well . I 'd like to offer $ 35 .
Hmm . what type fo wood is this unit ? I 'm not sure exactly , I believe it is pine . Okay , Would you take $ 18 for it ?
The vinyl is just ripped up . Ok , are the chains in good shape , frames bent ? They are in great condition as far as the frames and chains go . New tubes and seats and they will have plenty of life left in them .
i agree its a great truck , but with the way off road packages go its hard on the transmission and if nothing has been replaced it will all start to needing replacing in the next year or 10 k miles . why are you selling ? New baby on the way otherwise it would stay . i hear ya ! would you be willing to take 6 500 if i come tonight , anyone with truck knowledge will know it will need 5 k of work in the next year .
any bo og ers , bite marks , cracks ? its clan . how easy is it to dis as semble ?
Well that 's ok but I still can 't go under 120 . It 's already a 40 dollar drop so I think it 's very fair . Ok then how about 99 ? I go down 40 but you come up by 3 ? Doesn 't seem too reasonable though .
Hello , I am very interested in your cred enza . Can you tell me more about it ? It 's a wonderful mid - century cred enza . It 's in good shape for antique of this age , although there a some chips around the edges and marks on the top . The front is in beautiful shape and it has a nice rich tone and pat ina on the wal nut wood . That sounds good . Are you willing to negotiate on the price ?

Hello , how are you today ?
I would like to make an offer of $ 18 19 . 18 19 is far too low at the moment . This is a great house with great utilities too . The lowest I 'm willing to go is 2400 . I am a dentist , I will throw in two clean ings for each you and your immediate family members twice a year for two years if we can agree to $ 18 19 .
Hi , I 'm interested in renting your apartment , but my budget is a little below what you 're asking . Would you be able to negotiate on the price ? Yes I can lower it down a bit . How low would you be comfortable with ? I 'm shooting for $ 15 75 but I have some w iggle room . Maybe a longer lease would make it easier for you to lower the rent ?
hi , I am very interested in this bike .
But they are used . It 's only $ 10 dollars less . I only have $ 55 to offer . Yes they are used but new ones go for three times that $ 60 is my final offer . Nope . $ 55 . I think you are just being hard on me . I can 't afford to go higher and you need to get rid of them . I can pick them up from you myself if that helps .
Hello , are you looking to buy ? Yes . Does it come with the batteries ?
Hello are you interested in this unit ?

I 'm on a strict budget , but would be willing to pay $ 350 . I could also come and get it . I can do 400 last that 's about 150 less than what I am selling it . I think its a fair price . How about we meet in the middle somewhere ? $ 385 and I 'll still come and get it . ; ).
Like I mentioned , the car is fully loaded , low mileage , black r ims , blu etooth , Sony sound , key less entry and I had mood lighting added to it as well . Yeah , it looked to be in great condition . If you bring the price down to 18 , 000 i can come pick it up tonight . You seem like a nice person so I think we can work something out . How about 18 , 599 ?

I need a reasonable offer please . This is a professional bike . Thinking I 'll sell it for way less than half isn 't wise . How about I drop it to $ 800 ?
Hell there .
All right good point will you go down on the price ? What did you have in mind ? $ 25 is a steal for the mattress of your dreams : - ). I have to agree but I can 't see what it looks like as the picture has a sheet on it . How about 22 .
Hello !
Hello and welcome ! Are you interested in buying my property ? Yes I definitely am . Are you flexible on the price at all ?
Hello . what are some of the features . The table has a glass top and bottom as well . Also the table adjusts up and down .
Very nice . The listing says it is new . Can you tell me why you are selling it ? I had already purchased one for each member of the family , but mom dropped one off for me to try because she didn 't know that . OK , fair enough , so is it still sealed in the box or have you opened it ?

10 . 95 a can for pine shine . Ok . That sounds like I great deal . ok then 190 with the pine shine .
That may be , but this house has 4 bedrooms , 2 bathrooms and a 2 car garage . It also comes with a was her / dry er / d ish washer / st ove and oven , and has a large patio and backyard . The yard is also m owed and maintained by my associate , so you never have to worry about doing yard work . O oh , I like the sound of that . Yard work is a pain .

Hello there ! Any questions about the apartment ? Can parking be included instead of additional ?
174 ? I could do that . sorry I typed 174 instead of 164 . $ 165 and you have a deal .
What age group would you think appropriate for the kids ? My son is 10 , and he has used it for two years . So I would say anywhere from 9 - 12 . Ok , that sounds good . My kid is 11 so he could easily get at least one year riding . What is the least you 'll take for it ?
It was used a little , I bought it thinking I would be able to do some work at home , but then we had our third child , and we need to make the home office a play room . Otherwise , I would be keeping this desk . I loved it . If you can pick up the desk , I w old be willing to sell it for $ 65 . Would you be able to go down to $ 55 to compensate the gas I would use coming to pick it up ? I will be willing to meet you half way between my last offer and your offer , $ 60 . The desk cost me quite a bit more than that .

Okay nice . What kind of price are you looking for here ? I was only trying to spend around 13 k . I could go down to closer to $ 20 k but not quite 13 k . Okay I can definitely go up to 20 k for a beauty like this . Thanks a lot , I can 't wait !
Hey there , I see you have n okia batteries . I 'd love to buy em !
Hello , I 'm very interested in the dining set . Would you be willing to take less than $ 600 ? I am desperate . Before we talk price , do you have any questions for me ? Sure ... is the furniture in good condition ? Any wear and tear I should be concerned about ?
That price is too low for me , they are in excellent condition so the listed price is already a good deal . I know it 's just a tight budget I have right now . I 'd be able to go up to $ 58 if that 's possible . Okay I can help you out a little . 60 and we got a deal .
No , none . If you have open windows at rush hour you may hear traffic , but other than that no . Okay . How many bedrooms do the apartments usually have ? Studio to 3 bedrooms .
The one in the picture ? It 's actually a chest - it was my parents , it 's pretty old but not sure if it qualifies as an antique yet ! @ . Yes I can see the photo now . It was a little dark . It is very nice . What is the condition ? Good condition , draw ers all move smoothly , finish is in good shape , it 's nice , it 's just too big to haul across the country .
No it doesn 't . It is in very good condition . I have not had it that long . Great , Can you come down on the price any ? I can go down to $ 275 . It is in like new condition .
It does come with all the appliances . The floor is very high quality hard wood . Other apartments in that area are much lower in price is there any way you could lower the price for me ? We can work with you a little on the price , but it has to be reasonable .

Okay , sounds good . How does $ 30 sound ? You 're getting 4 pairs ! I don 't think $ 10 each is too much . Plus they still have some battery life in them . Are they recharge able ?
Hi , I am inter sted in your cabinet . Does it have scratches ? The only real defects are a ring on the top from a glass or v ase . How many draw ers does it have ?
That is too low for such a fantastic town house . This has a 2 car attached garage , patio , covered side deck . It is close to downtown , parks , restaurants , and public transit . i did not see that it had a 2 car garage . That is great . It seems perfect for my small family of 3 . They will love this place .

Hello , that 's an interesting bike you have . Is it still available ?
I can give you 170 for it . I 'd prefer not to go below $ 180 . Since you are giving an extra battery and it is in good condition I will offer 180 .
yes it 's still available . Are you interested ? Yes looking for a phone for my niece does it have any scratches . You 've come up upon the right ad . To answer your question , no there are no scratches , it 's in great condition . I upgraded to an  iph one 7 which is why I 'm selling this one .
That is a nice ch andel ier you have . Thanks its great . Are you interested ? Yes I am , is it very old ? Does it have anything wrong with it ?

I 've had this beautiful desk for about 6 months now . It is is new condition , no damage whatsoever . How big are the draw ers . The are about 2 . 5 feet deep and around 1 . 75 wide .
Hey nice chair , would look perfect in my living room . Hey great chair for a great price . If you 're selling i 'm buying , what do you say , 540 ?
Sorry , I still can 't pay that much . The most I can pay is $ 750 for a used dining set . If you can come up with $ 850 I might be able to arrange for a neighbor of mine to use his truck , but I 'll need to pay him . That 's too much for me and I would feel better transporting it myself . How about $ 800 ?
One year . Would you be will to lower the price if I sign a 3 year lease ? That would be a good consideration . What 's your offer ?
How about $ 400 ? $ 420 and we have a deal . $ 410 ?
Hi , I 'm interested in your mountain bike . Is it still for sale ? Yes , I still have it . do you have any questions ?
Wow the mattress of my dreams .
Absolutely no scratches at all and it even comes with 3 D glasses if you 're into that kind of thing . I would like to make you a offer of 1000 . That s a tad low . I can do 1100 just for you , today .

I 'm sorry that wouldn 't be possible for this particular unit . The lowest we could go for this specific unit , taking into account your concerns about availability of laundry facilities , would be closer to 1500 . Could $ 14 00 work ? I 'm afraid not . Prices for 1 BR in this area are pretty standard . I was considering the price reduction due to your specific circumstances and laundry criteria . But that price would be too low for a 1 BR in this area . Are you sure 1500 isn 't work able ?
How does $ 1200 sound for it ? That is way out of the ballpark I was asking for , The lowest I would be willing to go currently would be around $ 1500 . I 'll only pay $ 1500 if I get to ride it around for a little bit first .
Hello - Are you interested in the apartment I have available ? I am ! How would you describe the neighborhood ? It is in a quiet neighborhood . There are a few younger kids but , this apartment is not near the playground where they can be heard . There is very little crime and everyone is friendly .
Hmm , that seems a little high . Would you be willing to go $ 3 , 000 ? This car is in great condition . It runs well . Just passed the sm og test . The mil age is high , which is my main concern . Things start to break down pretty quickly after the 100 , 000 mile mark on these cars . I have $ 3000 cash on hand , and am ready to buy .
what a nice place to live i would really like to get it as low as possible .
I can ship USPS for a couple of dollars . If you pay the shipping , I will go to 3 . 50 tops . I understand they are new but I will be getting a new  iph one soon and it will come with a pair . Your offer is tempting and I can come down to 4 . 00 including shipping .
Well I was really hoping to get the full asking price as it is a really great vintage piece . Did you have an offer in mind ? $ 96 , seeing as you found the shade and lamp se perate . Well I paid more than that for the two of them , and they really do go very well together . I could go as low as 120 I think , considering you 're a student .
I think 65 is a pretty fair price because it 's in really good condition and they are very high quality . I can go down to 60 . Would that work for you ? I can 't , I don 't really have the money right now , but I could use another chair in my dining room . What about $ 55 then ? Sorry but 60 is the lowest I can take for these since they are worth more than that .

You sound like you would make a great tenant . I can meet you in the middle at $ 28 00 , but I honestly can 't go any higher . Can you do $ 26 00 ? As it is , I 'm going to be eating ram en for a while . I can $ 26 00 on a 2 year lease , as long as you agree not to have any pets and keep the rental in excellent condition .

Hello . I 'm interested in the home you listed . Hello ! Do you have any specific questions about the listing ? I 'm here to help . Yes just a few . So does the $ 24 00 list price include utilities ? and I see that video surveillance is included , can you tell me a little about that ?
The last I can give you is $ 1600 . okay , great ! I will come down today to sign the lease ! Perfect ! Enjoy your new home ! I promise you won 't regret it !
Hi . Are you interested in the car ?
I would like to pay 365 for it , because I am on a tight budget , are there any features or bonuses that make it worth more than that ?? well the quality and rarity of the piece itself . but I could add in delivery for you if you pay the full price . What if I pick it up myself , could you come down in price ? Say 420 ?

hi there , i see you are interested in my space . I am very in et erest ed . But I was wondering if there was anything wrong with this ? no , everything is good . a non smoking apartment , its very clean .
I can 't , I don 't really have the money right now , but I could use another chair in my dining room . What about $ 55 then ? Sorry but 60 is the lowest I can take for these since they are worth more than that . But they are used . It 's only $ 10 dollars less . I only have $ 55 to offer .
yes I can pick them up and dis mat le as well . Sure ! Cash okay ? yes that works .
f itness center equ iment i 'm asking $ 14 87 can work with you also . Do you think we could go down to $ 11 30 . if i agree to $ 11 30 can you cover the rest of the fee in a few months .
I think 700 dollars might be a little too steep of a price for this couch . Could you possibly lower the price down to 500 ? Would you be able to take it right away ? Yes , I can come pick it up today if it is possible .
hi , is the apt available ? Yes ! This beautiful unit is available for $ 2200 . It 's a great neighborhood , but that 's really a lot for a one bedroom . How many sq . feet ?
306 ? I am supposed to go no lower than 350 ( this is according to my wife ) she will probably be so mad at me if I don 't get at least that , what do you say ? I can go up to 315 .
Im skeptical , though still interested . Are you willing to negotiate on price ? I 'm willing to pay with cash iers check to guarantee funds , and I have ample references . yes we can sure come to the same price . how about 2400 ? Oh wow , thats a lot higher than I was expecting . I 'm willing to maintain the lawn , and do yard work around the outside of the house to maintain property values and keep the neighborhood happy . If I do that , would you consider something more in the ballpark of 1900 ?

Any ways .... what utilities are included ? As per the scenario , it is a Beautiful 1 BR Ap artment at a Great Location !. The listed price is $ 16 33 .
B are ly used , we bought it for my daughter but it doesn 't fit her . Would you be willing to take $ 120 for it ? I mean it was used once , I 'd probably take 160 for it , because it cost me 250 originally .
We could only negotiate in the rent amount only . Okay , we 'll final ize it for $ 14 00 . Ag ree ? 1000 and it 's a deal . 1000 is too low , can you tell what is the maximum you can accept for ?
I 'm very interested in the pointer . I 'll give you 18 for it , and I 'll come and pick it up . Great . I 'm afraid I need a little more for it than that . How about 30 ? That 's still pretty high .

Have you cleaned it with brass cleaner at all . Of course ! It 's in super special awesome condition ! But ... does it '' do '' anything ? Does the pin wheel spin ? It doesn 't look like it spins ...
All of the appliances are included . This is a very nice house for the price , and you 're not going to find something in the area for cheaper than $ 23 00 . The highest I can go is $ 22 50 . $ 22 50 is fine .

Hi is the table still for sale ?
I 'm not quite sure on the name . but it looks splendid . It 's a huge house , 16 51 sq feet . 3 bedroom 1 bath . animals approved *. Is there a fence in the backyard ? Does it have central AC ? Is there a driveway / gar age or is it street parking ? Yes the res a fence , and a garage , and the res central air . One year lease minimum at $ 18 95 is a killer deal , don 't you think ?
Will you take $ 25 ? 25 is a little low . I could do 30 $. I paid over 50 $ for it , so this is a good deal . I will take it for $ 30 .
would you be willing to take $ 1000 for it ? I 'm afraid I couldn 't just let it go for $ 1000 . Would you be willing to up your offer ? I am willing to meet you in the middle at $ 1100 and I can come and pick it up today .

Hi I 'm interested in the bike .
The Schw inn does . It 's simply from dis use . It 's in top notch condition otherwise , garage kept since i got them . It 's a little bit higher in price than I wanted to spend . Would you consider $ 65 if I come to you and pick it up ? well , they 're in pretty good shape , and my listed price is for the pair ... would you be willing to go for $ 70 ? that 'll take the cost of a patch kit off the list price . I think that 's a good compromise .

The lowest I will go is $ 700 and no other perks . That 's just too high for me . Are you sure ? $ 700 is more than fair .
Wow ! This looks great ! Are you looking to sign a one year lease ? This is a great home for families , and the 2 car garage is a bonus . I would love to sign a lease ! Great ! How are there schools ?
HI ! The rug is still available . Are you interested ? Very it is beautiful ! Are you the original owner ? I am . I have recently washed it and it is pet hair free and from a smoke free home .
hello , are you interested in this apartment complex ? I am , how much is a 2 bedroom , the ad doesn 't specify bedrooms available .
Sure thing ! The $ 24 00 . 00 does include all utilities . The video surveillance can turned off and on at the resident 's consent but we like to offer our residents peace of mind with the surveillance feature . Fantastic , I really need to move into a place by the end of the week . Would that be possible ? Certainly , you can come down to our office during normal business hours to take care of the paperwork .
OK , Because it is old technology , I am only willing to pay $ 10 . Can you accept that ? I think $ 15 would be fair considering it still works perfectly . You never stop needing directions , and this thing will get you where you need to go ! I can only pay $ 13 . My final offer .

Cool , it 's in great shape . I only have a 35 budget but , I also have a bottle of whiskey I was just gifted for my birthday but ... I dont drink whiskey . Since it looks like you do , I was wondering if you would take 35 plus a brand new bottle of whiskey ? given the camera is in working condition . What brand is the whiskey ?

I initially wanted $ 1800 O BO but now I have it listed at $ 13 00 priced to sell . Wow , nice , but I would need closer to 1 , 000 . $ 12 50 ? It 's a great tri ke and I 've upgraded so many aspects of it .
They are in great condition as far as the frames and chains go . New tubes and seats and they will have plenty of life left in them . Cool , is the 25 per bike or is that for both ? That is actually for each bike but if you take both I can do $ 40 .
Do you have additional information about it ? 24 pounds . sh im ano de ore  xt cr anks et . egg be ater pedals disc brakes . rock sh oc racing fork ds . r itcher comp handle bars and stem . indeed this bike is state of the art . I would give you 500 for it in cash . I 'll pick it up and get it out of your hair .
i understand your travel costs , if you come up to $ 190 i think we have a deal . I think I can do that but considering not just the travel but the scratches the best I can do is 186 . the extra dollar isn 't too enticing . I have other people who I can negotiate with . $ 190 is my final offer to you .
Wow that is great . Would you be willing to do $ 150 . I guess $ 300 is a good price but i come down to $ 250 because i want to just sell off the printer . The highest I can go is $ 220 .
Hey there , you 're interested in the bike ?
Hi ! I am very interested in this ap arn ment . Is it still available ? It is ! It 's a great place . Small and quiet and very spacious . What are the schools like ? Are there any kid friendly areas , such as parks , in the area ?
They ran it over while I was having a garage sale . I was asking 100 for it at that sale . After the accident I did not try to sell it . I can do $ 60 for this one . I could get it today with cash in hand . If we can meet in the middle at $ 80 we have a deal .

well the quality and rarity of the piece itself . but I could add in delivery for you if you pay the full price . What if I pick it up myself , could you come down in price ? Say 420 ? I could do it for $ 450 ..
I am looking at your bike . How old is it ? hello , it is a few years old . Did you keep up with regular tune ups on the bike ?
Hi , so you are interested ? I am but i have some questions first . Does this place come with any utilities included in the asking price ? What is the neighborhood like ? no actually utilities are extra , the neighborhood is nice , full of good people that don 't hesitate to help in case you need them .
Can you hear a lot of noise and traffic from inside of the apartments ? No , none . If you have open windows at rush hour you may hear traffic , but other than that no . Okay . How many bedrooms do the apartments usually have ?
Hello I am really interested in buying your phone , but I had a few questions .
H mmm how about 50 each so 200 . for $ 225 i will throw in a box of unused divid ers and folders . So how much each ?

Hi I am trying to find the right owner for my bike what is your budget ? 306 ?
I can 't go that low , but would be willing to split the difference and go with $ 90 . That sounds fine . Great ! You won 't be disappointed .
I can definitely put it on thank you . Your welcome . Can I pick it up today ?
Hello hello , how are you doing tonight ?
Hi - I saw your bike posted and would like more information on it please . how are the tires ? Thank you for your interest . They were recently replaced and are in excellent shape . Ok - is this a 10 , 12 , 18 or 21 speed ?
That 's why I 'm offering it at 40 % off . I can throw in a small TV stand to house it if you are willing to pay the asking price . That price is a bit high for me . Would you consider $ 200 cash ? If this was a gift from someone to you for Christmas , it is like getting free money and freeing up some space .... W ont find an unused one anywhere near this price anywhere . Can 't go lower than $ 300 .
$ 1000 is way too low . How about $ 1500 ? That 's still out of my budget . I could go as high as $ 1 . 200 and it does seem like the perfect bike . I 'd hate to miss out . That 's still a little low . I 've got a cover for it so you can keep it outside all year round . I 'll throw that in . How about $ 13 50 ?
Well , my wife isn 't currently working because we just had a child , so our budget is a bit reduced . However , we 'd still like to buy a home to have a little extra space for our expanded family . I was hoping I could get something for around $ 1500 . That sounds fair . How about 1800 ? Does that sound fair to you ? I mean , it 's a little over my budget , but with the f enced backyard and the easy commute to work , I think that 's a good price . Additionally , in a few months my wife will be back to work , so we 'll only have the extra financial stress for a short time , hopefully . I can do $ 1800 .

Hello , I am interested in the Pri us you have listed for sale ... Hey , it is still available . Only has 180 , 000 highway miles , I am asking $ 45 00 .
Yes , since this unit does not have laundry hook - up it would be reasonable to lower the asking price . What price were you thinking might work better for you ? I was hoping closer to $ 1000 . I 'm sorry that wouldn 't be possible for this particular unit . The lowest we could go for this specific unit , taking into account your concerns about availability of laundry facilities , would be closer to 1500 .

I don 't have any children , Thank God . lol . H aha . Are you willing to take a little off the price ? I already have it price pretty low , even lower than Blue Book . It 's a really clean car .
That would be acceptable , at $ 350 . Is there any chance I could pay you 342 instead ... It 's a superst ition thing ... 350 is bad luck ... That is fine . Unfortunately , I dislike the number $ 342 . Instead , $ 347 .
I am willing to pay max 250 just because it 's so new . I 'm so sorry that that 's your max price ! I have had it custom painted and it has a set of p ann iers from Amsterdam . 275 max and thats final .
Yes I am !! Do you allow pets ? Only cats and small dogs are allowed . I 'm asking for 1995 . Is that acceptable for you ? I was going to offer you $ 18 35 , I have 2 children under 4 so budget is real tight these days ..
The only real defects are a ring on the top from a glass or v ase . How many draw ers does it have ? There is a top and bottom cabinet as well as a hidden drawer in the top part .
It has no issues like that at all , perfectly safe . It just has a couple areas with ch ipped paint . Sounds good . Could you take $ 1000 for it . I would be happy to pick it up . I couldn 't go down all that low . It 's worth at least 1800 in this condition as I 've seen many sold at that price . Mine is priced to sell quickly so it 's already been lowered . 1400 good ?
We can work with you a little on the price , but it has to be reasonable . Can you come down to 1200 ? That 's too low . 1400 if you put down a month and a half deposit .
Are there any problems with it ? Major scratches or anything ? Just one or two minor scratches . That is all . How does $ 1200 sound for it ?

I was wondering what kind of apartments you have available , are there any on the ground floor with a patio or yard ? We do have one available on the ground floor that has small patio . Its a 2 bed 2 bath . Oh , that sounds great . Do you accept pets ? Are there any kind of fees for them ?
I 'm sorry , but that won 't even cover the proper y taxes levied by the governments of Ple as enton , CA . Seems like a problem a property owner deals with . Cover my maid and laundry service and I 'll go up to $ 3000 . Sorry , but that 's a serious lose situation for me . the nature of pricing is that costs are always flowed to the consumer . I 'll be able to fill this resort - style am ene it ie home with rolling lawn s and parks , and boutique shops , with a ren ter if you find yourself unable to come to terms with the cost of living ... also , the sooner we come to an agreement , the more of these H ITS we can do per hour . 35 00 / mo final price .
Are there any scratches or kn icks I SH OU DL BE AW ARE OF ? There is one small scratch that happened the last time I moved . Where is that located ? Is it visible ?
hello ! i am interested in you tac oma you have posted , how many miles are on it ?
I understand - I am ready to work with you on this . As you know , this is a quality bike and well worth the asking price , however there is some room for negotiation . so what do you think of 850 . I can come down some - I would take $ 1000 .
I am interested . What are you looking for ? I was hoping to get 60 dollars for it . It is in good condition and the tires are almost brand new . I understand that . However , I do see that I 'll need to replace the chain and put air in the tires , so that 's a bit of a disadvantage to me . How about $ 50 ?
Yes , I had the chairs professionally rep ur posed so that they would be restored to an excellent condition . How much are you asking for the set ? I 'm asking $ 100 for the entire set .
Hi there . Yes I am . Is this new ? Yes correct . what 's the lasting power ?

Never have . We have a non pet and non smoking home . It does not have any r ips or tears either . Has it been out where you can walk on it ? It has been walked on but since it is good quality you can not see wear on it .
a ? Sorry typo a lazy Susan I for your drinks and it sw ive ls for easier access . oh i see , although it looks like a beautiful dining room set , $ 1000 seems awfully steep for a used set . ill give you $ 500 for it .

Hi how are you ! I am , but it has alot of miles on it , even with the new groups et , brakes and rot ors . I 'll buy it for 1200 if you drive it here . 12 50 and you have a deal , if you have any questions about the bike let me know . I 'll gladly take it for 12 50 , you 'll deliver right ?
I am new in the area , are you close to city center ? Yes we are just 5 miles from there . We have beautiful walk ways to that lead out toward the city center . Oh , 5 miles is too far to walk for my job . Is it a g ated community ?
This is a bit steep for my budget . How about something in the range of $ 2000 , Ill even come on one of the off season periods when bu is ness isn 't that great . $ 20 75 an you have a deal . Alright , I think I can pull the extra $ 75 , but only because it has a " View * ".

ex cellent condition , barely used at all . I see this bike is worth about $ 160 new , so your asking price is too high . I think you are mistaken this model is much more new . I am just asking $ 150 .
My friend has to come anyway since my car is in the shop . What is the lowest you 'll go on price please ? I need the cash too if you can do at least 40 you can come pick it up . I take the vacuum if you are giving it away . ok $ 40 sounds good , it looks like a great desk .
Hi there , do you know who the artist was for this lamp ?
yes bought it for my wife and she ended up not using it , so here am , it 's been stored in the garage so it 's well kept for and i 't s like new . What is the least you will accept for it ? i would be willing to lower the price to $ 175 if you can pick it up .
No d ings or scratches it was covered with a dining cloth most of the time . and the chair covers are there any stains on them ? No stains on the chair covers and they are wash able and replace able if you do happen to stain them .
I like the off - road tires , and it looks awesome but 13 000 is a little high . I was hoping that you could let it go for 7000 . It 's still 13 years old . I apologize as I can 't go to $ 7 000 . Could you do $ 10000 ? Its from 2004 and to get it up to emission standards is going to be a pain . If you can get to standard and throw in some hub caps , I can do $ 95 00 .
I am interested in your car . What is the best offer you have received ? I had an offer of 17 000 , that 's a bit too low for me , as I need to pay my debt off . That s too high for me . I can offer 14 000 today cash .
ok how about $ 370 I like the chair but it is used and you also can 't gar unte e comfort . How about 400 and I 'll deliver it myself ? how about 385 and I will meet you halfway .

Ok well this is a unique find and It is in great shape . I am asking 55 for it . It is , I was thinking a bit lower , around 30 . I could pick it up myself . That 's awesome . I think that is a fair offer , but I can only go down to 40 .
It comes with a wall charger . Is this a used item ? Yes but it is very good condition . I 've lowered the price to $ 50 and I 'll even deliver it to you and help you set it up if you 'd like .
I simply can not afford to pay anything near that much per month . I can make you a sl igh l ty better offer for this excellent studio . It has a full kitchen with gas stove and oven , and plenty of storage room ! I simply can not pay anything near $ 1 , 500 per month . My budget will not allow it .
Baby , you don 't ne eeee ee ed to re - uph ol ster this chair , but you want too . Which I admire . I have it listed for $ 50 , but the only way you are going to get it for $ 30 is taking me on a date , which he won 't care . So , just give me the $ 10 now for the date , cause I 'm a pill and a half . $ 40 . I 'm quite sure he won 't . I can 't go over $ 35 . That 's not even an amount you can get out of the ATM , what is that liquor store money . $ 40 baby , $ 40 , this thing hasn 't even been sat on . It 's a " collect able custom " chair , HA ! Re - uph oster it twice , I don 't care . $ 40 .
Hi how are you !
Hi ! That sounds good . However , $ 50 seems way too high for this item . It only has 3 microphones . The newer models have 5 ! Would you take $ 25 ? How about $ 30 ?
hello . Hello . I am looking for a new vehicle and read over your listing . Can you give me an estimate on what gas mileage to expect ? Well thanks for checking out the listing ! Gas mileage is great and you wont have to worry about refuel ing on your trips out of state . its around 29 on highways .
Hi , I am short on cash , but need the drawer chest . Can you take $ 40 if I come pick it up today . Cash ! Deal ? The chest was $ 120 brand new , and I think $ 40 is far too low . I can certainly sell it to someone else for my asking price of $ 75 -- a bargain ! Yes , but the chest is used and that knocks at least 50 % off the price . How about $ 50 ?

Sounds good . I have a limited budget . What 's the least you 'll accept for it ? I can go as lot as $ 125 and you have to pick it up . It 's a great bike , you can 't overlook this one ! I can do $ 125 and I 'll pick it up this evening . Thanks !
Hi are you interested in the apartment ? I am . what size is it ? We have multiple sizes av a ible to lease , our most popular option is the 2 bedroom , 2 bath option and that includes full utilities .
Yes I have a unit in Liver more . They don 't last long ! Can you tell me the amenities ? We have a laundry room , picnic table , b b q in the common grounds and parking spaces .
The appliances are not included , but all utilities are included in rent . h mmm ... that 's an expense I was not counting on . What do you call a fair price ? $ 4000 Is the asking price , I can assure you it is worth well over that .
No damage at all . And it come from a pet free and smoke free home . What is your bottom dollar for this set ? I would like to stay close to asking if possible . What did you have in mind ? It is a pretty good deal for so many pieces .
Yes , do you have good credit and past rental references ? Yes , I have all of that . so it would be $ 1900 and all that would be included .
no way , and like I said not possible for this model . I say take your chance on there if you like , sounds like a scam . I can come down slightly to 125 but that is it . It is definitely the same one with comments from buyers on am azon . Will you take 95 ? I am wanting to get rid of this quickly but feel that is just too low , 115 is my final offer .
h uh . I have a bike for sale , but its sold . Uh I 'm trying to negotiate the purchase of a security system ... what bike are you talking about ?

I 'll stuck to my 1100 . Sorry but I have more charges I need to pay with the place . Based on your friendly approach and speaking manner , I will lose my margin money also now . Since I don 't want to leave you , I come down to $ 13 00 and believe you 'll utilize this opportunity . Since parking isn 't included which will probably cost over 100 because of the great location and utilities cost over 200 dollars a month , I cannot put down more on rent when some things are included . I 'll do 1 125 but that 's the highest I can go . I have to eat too .
It 's not going to sell right away , so I 'm willing to bargain . What 's your offer ? Yeah it 's got to go to the right buyer , someone that will cherish it 's uniqueness . I 'll give you 18 . I could settle on 22 dollars if it 's cash .
Hello , I 'm interested in your 3 D glasses . Hi , I don 't know much of the tech y stuff , my husband does , but I do know we only used them about 5 times before our tv broke . They are in perfect condition and have never been dropped . Okay , sounds good . How does $ 30 sound ?
I 'm asking $ 250 for the bike , and pick up would be ideal . H mmm the list price says 200 , and I was hoping to get it for less than that ... I can go down to $ 175 .
I understand maybe we can work something out but I won 't be approved by my boss if I go too low . The apartment is smoke free and I can offer you the first month of rent for free , if you 're able to pay 2000 per month ? 2000 would be great . Do you do any kind of background checking ? There is no background check at all ! So we should be able to get you in very quickly . There is also a swimming pool and workout equipment center and we also have 24 hour security cameras for the rentals .
Hey . I was looking to buy a home and I came across your ad . I have an outdoor only dog , so I must ask if the back yard is f enced ? Yes it is . How much are you looking to spend on this ? Well , my wife isn 't currently working because we just had a child , so our budget is a bit reduced . However , we 'd still like to buy a home to have a little extra space for our expanded family . I was hoping I could get something for around $ 1500 .
Considering it isn 't the latest model , I think $ 165 is a little unreasonable . I was thinking around $ 80 would be fair . It may not be the latest model but it 's in great working condition , well cared for and professionally stored it is in new condition in box . I 'm unable to go lower than $ 125 . Would you be able to deliver it to me ?
Does this have any damage ? Its a nice a struct urally sound piece that has shelves that can pull out for storage of videos or c ds or anything actually . Would you take a lower price ? I 'd pay 15 cash today .

Hi there . How old is this desk ?
Hi , I 'm interested in buying this bike . Can you tell me what the upgrades are ? I can offer an extended warrant on top of a quality assurance warranty and have spare set of tires in addition to an erg onomic seat pad . That 's great . Would you be willing to sell it for $ 900 if I pick it up and don 't require a test ride ?
Hi , I understand the bike will need some work done . Hello , yes but it just needs a new chain and some air in the tires .. I do not believe there is anymore damage as its just been sitting at my mothers house . Oh alright . Considering the chain and tires need work done , I 'm willing to pay $ 42 .
Hello .
It is lovely . Call it $ 300 and you have a deal . $ 325 and I take it to your house . It is quite heavy and I got a truck . You can relax and be pretty . You have a deal .
The matt resses are in excellent condition and still have the plastic over them ! We bought the bunk bed set for our kids , but they still slept in the guest room on a queen bed . Oh . That 's great ! I have $ 200 and I can pick them up today . I would be happy to take them off your hands . $ 200 is a bit lower than I will accept due to the matt resses being brand new . Right now the lowest I will take is $ 250 .
That 's good to know . Now lets get to the real thing here . The price is too high for me . What can we do about it ? Well , let 's negotiate a price we can both agree to . I am willing to pay $ 29 as that fits my budget just now .

Hello . Thanks for viewing the listing .
Has it even been wrecked ? No , it has a clean slate . No accidents ! I really like this su v , I see that you are asking $ 3000 ? I am willing to take the V UE off your hands for $ 27 00 cash .
I am . Can you tell me how old this is ? What condition is it in ? Funny story actually . My neighbor backed over my old one so his insurance bought be a new one . My son is too old for it now so the one that i am selling is brand new , has never even been used . Oh my ! Well , I am a single mother and my child could really use this . Would you be willing to come down on the price considering you got a brand new replacement for your used one ?
Hi . I see that you have some bunk beds for sale . Can you tell me what condition the matt resses are in ? Any stains or tears ?
I see this bike is worth about $ 160 new , so your asking price is too high . I think you are mistaken this model is much more new . I am just asking $ 150 . I just checked and it 's the same exact model selling for $ 160 new on e bay and am azon . Used they are like $ 80 , will you take 80 ?
It 's a wonderful mid - century cred enza . It 's in good shape for antique of this age , although there a some chips around the edges and marks on the top . The front is in beautiful shape and it has a nice rich tone and pat ina on the wal nut wood . That sounds good . Are you willing to negotiate on the price ? I can negotiate some . Would you go for $ 500 ?
Hello , I like your wind mill and might be interested in buying it ... can you tell me a bit about it ... It 's a whims ical wall structure ! Perfect for interior decoration ! And it 's a pin wheel . How long have you owned it ?
ok ay sounds good , could you take $ 490 ? I can 't go lower than at least $ 510 . can we meet at $ 500 ?

Nothing deep into the wood , it is a used item but a little wood polish and elbow grease and it will look new . That 's great to hear , do you know what kind of wood it is made of ? I actually am not sure , but I looked it up and to the best of my knowledge it looks like western red c edar .
I 'm not sure if $ 20 is what I 'd want . These glasses are still in great condition . How about $ 30 ? I think that $ 25 would be better . Lets say $ 25 and call this done . What do you think ? Deal .
I apologize , but I can 't accept $ 80 , as I was really looking to get $ 100 for it . Would $ 93 work for you ? If we could make it an even $ 90 , we would have a deal . Give me $ 91 and I 'll deliver it to you . Deal ?
Yes it does , but it doesn 't include parking . We can negotiate a fair price and I can include parking as well if you 're offer is decent . Would you be willing to lease it for $ 1 , 400 ? Would you be willing to bring it up to $ 1 , 500 ?
Its been owned for 2 years , I 'll sell it to you for 450 . That is quite high and is unfortunately out of my budget ... would you consider negotiating the price if I can pick it up in person ? I can negotiate but don 't low ball me , I 'll offer it for 425 .
Actually the ad says the seat is for sale at $ 50 . But I may be winning to come down on the price if you 're willing to provide your own transportation . Oops sorry my mistake that was a typo ! I would be willing to pay $ 35 . I have cash in hand and will pick it up today . How about $ 40 and you pick it up ?
Oh yes , that would make a big difference . It is a beautiful home and nice neighborhood . I can 't see it very well in the photo , the trees and bushes seem very over grown ...

You 're in luck . We 're planning a trip to Bog ota , Columbia . Wow - what luck ! Ok , since the bike is 8 years old , I can offer $ 650 for it . Is that something you would consider ? That 's a serious offer , but the bike cost far more than that new and it has been maintained properly . I 'm also bringing it to you which sh aves a lot off of delivery costs . $ 700 sounds better to me .
Hello . This has just been reduced down to $ 700 . Great ! Is it in good condition ? It is in great condition . It is hardly used .
Hi !
how old is it ? It 's about 5 years old . are you willing to accept $ 300 for it ?
Looks amazing ! I would need a 6 month lease , since Im active military . Could we do that ? Yes I can work that out for you , should I send you the offer then ? If i paid the whole 6 months plus the deposit , could we work out a discount price ? I like to be money sav y haha .
Hi , yes I am ! Ok well this is a unique find and It is in great shape . I am asking 55 for it . It is , I was thinking a bit lower , around 30 . I could pick it up myself .

There 's a park nearby . And there are convenient transportation options if you need to travel for work . Great ! How many rooms in the home ? 4 bedrooms , 2 bathrooms . We may be able to partition more rooms if that 's more convenient for your family .

I should have said that some of the 2 bedrooms are this price but generally it is the price range for the 3 bedrooms . All utilities are included with all apartments and there are some other extras too ! I was really hoping to stay closer to 1000 do you by any chance have any specials going on right now ? There are specials but let me ask which amount of bedrooms are you looking for ?
Well , I suppose I could take it off your hands then . I 'd like to pay $ 73 50 . That price is a bit too low for me . I think $ 10 , 000 would be a fair price . I couldn 't do $ 10 , 000 . I 'd be willing to drive to you and pick up the car , and I 'd offer $ 86 00 .
Hi !
Has the bike been used a lot ?
I can split the difference and meet you at $ 6 200 . $ 61 50 ? $ 6 175 .
Hi . I 'm interested in a 1 bedroom . Any amenities ?

Hello there , how are you today ? Yes we do have one parking space available . i 'm great . and the park ign space helps . this is a bit over my price range . what if I sign a 1 year lease , what 's my rent then ? I am glad to hear that you are great ! Well you have to bear in mind that all utilities and internet are included and also you have a full kitchen as well . If you sign a 1 year lease I can give it to you for $ 14 00 .
that is correct , I repeat that is correct , near the back tire . OK . So looking at new models of this bike , I see they sell for about $ 13 00 . $ 1200 seems a bit high , but you have taken great care of it . Would you be willing to consider an offer of $ 900 cash and I will come and pick it up ? I would consider a thousand , if you can come and pick it up , don 't forget I added more stuff compared to the new ones on the market .
Great , do you have any questions ? I was wondering if you are willing to take 100 less for it ? Also where did you keep the bike ? It is garage kept ever since I have owned it . It is top of the line . All new parts and rarely rid en . I would not accept 100 . 00 I would work on my asking price of 1200 . 00 though .
hey ,. this thing 's been in a storage for 18 months ? any bed bugs or mold ? No . It is in great condition and does not have any bugs , or mold . still 700 is a bit pricey . i can do 400 for this seeing as how it 's 7 years old .
For that I would be willing to go at $ 55 . 50 . Ok the extra 5 is gonna burn my wallet . $ 55 it is !
Hello , I wanted to know id the patio set is still available ? it is available . It 's the table and 2 chairs . is the paint ch ipped ?
Hello ! Did you have a lot of fun with the car ?
You have an offer in mind ? Sorry about that . Hit the button too quick ! Yes . I 'm on a pretty strict budget , but I would be willing to pay $ 60 . no problem . Although you say you 're on a budget , $ 60 would be too low . Would you like to make another offer and I will see what I can do .

May I have some more information about this car please . Does it have sat all ite radio ?
its a 2016 . The tires are spectacular ! Its only got 8 k miles on engine , so there is a ton of tread left for you to coast through the sunset with . You 're also getting key less entry in this model as well as ALL leather interior . It doesn 't get better than that . Would you consider taking $ 19 000 for the car so some funds are left over for taxes and registration ? How bout we settle for 20 , 000 BUT , Ill add a blu etooth adapt or and mood lighting in the vehicle Before i hand you the keys .
I go down 40 but you come up by 3 ? Doesn 't seem too reasonable though . Well it is a used lamp also I 'm working with a budget plus come on it doesn 't look like it 's worth that much money how about 105 . Well I believe it 's worth 160 so asking you for 120 is already a good deal . My absolute lowest is 115 and that 's really just take it or leave it . I can 't give it away .
The system is brand new , never opened the box . 3 wall speakers and 5 ceiling speakers . That 's nice . I can 't do 499 for it though . I can do 200 in cash and I have an PS 4 that I need to get rid of . Would you take that for it ? I 'll take the $ 200 and ps 4 .
$ 450 is too high for me . I can come up with $ 400 if you could deliver . 425 and I 'll deliver it . deal .
That 's great ! Does it have any physical damage on it ? Like scratches or anything ? Absolutely no scratches at all and it even comes with 3 D glasses if you 're into that kind of thing . I would like to make you a offer of 1000 .

Yes , but the chest is used and that knocks at least 50 % off the price . How about $ 50 ? I am not certain 50 % off is accurate . Have you ever bought a used car or house ? How about $ 65 ? Yes I have bought both used before . Honestly , I just cannot afford the price . I just moved and I have had to pay a lot of costs plus a deposit . I need somewhere to put my clothes . Can you do $ 65 ?
Nice . Can you work with me on the price any ? I 've got about 1100 . Well I do have an offer for 1300 for tomorrow so if you could match that and pick it up today we have a deal . 1200 and I will pick it up today ! And your tri ke will be going to someone who really appreci ates it !
there is both laundry facilities on site and a laundry conc ier ge service . OK , can it be guaranteed that I get one of the upgraded apartments ? Yes it can , you 're one of the first buyers so I can definitely guarantee that .
135 K miles is a lot , even with a new transmission there are probably parts going bad that I will have to deal with $ 2500 and I will pick it up and take care of the title transfer . I simply cannot go that low sorry . If you have records of all service performed on the car I could meet you at $ 35 00 but that is my absolute max .
does the truck have good mileage if so i can do $ 10 500 . it is . lets make a deal how about $ 11 , 000 and you drop it off .
I 'm looking for 45 but am willing to do 38 . Well , I 'll do $ 35 , and I 'll come by your house tonight to pick it up ? Sounds like a deal . 35 it is and I 'll give you the address .
It 's a 2015 C rave Pro . It 's in perfect condition and comes with lots of delicious features . Only ridden 100 miles . I 'm asking $ 1100 . Would you accept $ 1000 cash and I will come get it myself ? I will take $ 1000 if you come and pick her up . i 'll text you my address in just a moment .
These are some really high quality cameras that are only slightly used and in new condition . Also they are in the original box . Nice , are you willing to work with me on the price ? Certainly but I cant do any ex ager rated price cuts .

I have not but my grandfather used them all the time up until he died and they worked and sounded great . It says in the ad that your grandfather passed away " a couple of years ago ." I 'm sorry for your loss by the way . I want vintage but I want vintage that works . How about I pay 75 , and I 'll take them as is , no questions asked . 75 sounds good . You can test them out for yourself . I am sure that they still work fine .
Hi there , I am interested but have a few questions .

Great ! How many rooms in the home ? 4 bedrooms , 2 bathrooms . We may be able to partition more rooms if that 's more convenient for your family . That s great ! How much ?
The price seems a bit high for a older used item . I would like to offer $ 300 . I would give it a good home . I would go $ 325 if you could pick it up this week ? If you would deliver it to me I would be willing to to pay $ 325 .
I would really like to get at le ast $ 4 200 for the car . The ke lly blue book value of the car is $ 55 00 so I 'm already losing money by selling it . I couldn 't pay that much , but I can do $ 38 00 for it . Would that work ? I can do $ 4 , 000 but that 's my lowest I can go .

Hey I 'm interested in your TV . How firm is the price ? It seems a bit steep for a used plasma TV . Actually I am rather firm this tv is selling used for over 1200 all over the place . Mine is lower by a bit because i need it to go quick . Why how much were you thinking ? I was looking to spend more around 49 7 dollars . I can find pl as mas all day at the same size for a similar price . I would be willing to use cash , come pick it up , and toss in a mint condition  iph one at that price .
You wanna buy my  iph one ? Yes . What is the lowest you are willing to go for it ? I see it is unlocked so it 'll work on any network , right ? Yes , any carrier . It 's $ 150 .
hello I am selling my cabinet . It is a beautiful cabinet and I am interested in buying it . its one of my favorites and although it has a few flaws I am asking $ 300 for it .
Wow , in that case I would have to have a lower price to take it off your hands . $ 20 ? Are you kidding me ? It was signed by Risk y Business Tom Cruise , not Couch Jump ing Tom Cruise . I 'm pretty sure you didn 't know that just now . I wish it was Top Gun Tom Cruise , or Top Gun 2 Tom cruise soon enough . ok . Let 's do $ 1 for ever 1000 brush strokes . So $ 31 That 's a little Risk y , but fair .
hi , i like this but I only $ 15 to spend , do you have any room to come down ? Hi There ! Are you interested in buying .

Well , it really is a fabulous product ! You 'll love that it helps relieve back pain ! How old is it ? It 's new and never used !

Are you looking for a cabinet to store items ? I have one and am moving so I wanted to check with you . Does this have any damage ?
This is a dual master so that means it has two master bedrooms . You could fit 3 in each bed so 6 people total . Well it would just be my wife and me . It will be nice to have the guest room too . We have no pets . Everything else about it sounds great , except that we have to commute to the city for work . We were thinking something more along the $ 2500 - 28 00 range for a suburban home . If you contract to stay in the home for a year we could bring the rent to $ 28 00 a month .
Hello , I would like to purchase this item . If I pick it up in person , can you give me a discount ? Yes i can , say 10 % off . I can pay cash today . Would you take $ 15 .
I 'm sorry to hear that :( how tall are they ? roughly 4 feet tall ( each draw is a foot ). I found these new on Amazon for 70 .. would you possibly take 63 each if I bought all of them ?
Yes I see the chair you have for sale is about 6 months old . I really looking to pay that much for a used chair . I was wondering if you would entertain a much lower price ? It 's a really nice , comfortable chair made from a durable material . I won 't accept anything lower than $ 35 . I 'm afraid I really would looking at around 20 dollars not to insult you but it is used .
I 've been riding for a couple years now . I see the listing mentions its for big people . So does it not work for kids ? It would be good for large teenagers who are over 5 ' 4 " but not smaller than that . Younger children won 't be able to reach the pedd les . However , the frame does allow for both a trailer and a second seat for a passenger . Great ! How about $ 720 ?
how old are the tire ? less than a year . what is your price ?
Like from the original purchase price , if I were to give it to you for 5 k , that 's the cost of a Y aris with no camera , g ps navigation , and the couple hundred dollars I sunk into getting the f ender b ender professionally fixed . Oh , it has a camera ? Is that a back - up camera ? Y up , it has a nice back - up camera so you never hit anything , decent included sound system as is with Y aris , the moon ro of / sun ro of all work and were barely used , as well as the power lift gate / power windows .

Hello , what 's the gas mileage like ?
Awesome would you take 450 by chance ? I was hoping to get $ 500 for them . They are of superior quality . i can do that $ 500 with free delivery ...
What would you be able to offer ? My budget is $ 560 . Do you have a vehicle to come and pick it up ?
I understand that . However , I do see that I 'll need to replace the chain and put air in the tires , so that 's a bit of a disadvantage to me . How about $ 50 ? 50 dollars might work . I can only accept cash payments though , Is that alright with you ? That 's fine with me . I 'll agree to 50 in cash only .
Hi . I 'm interested in your car . Is it still available ? Hello ! It is available but there has been some interest in it recently . How many miles does it have on it ?
Ok then how about 99 ? I go down 40 but you come up by 3 ? Doesn 't seem too reasonable though . Well it is a used lamp also I 'm working with a budget plus come on it doesn 't look like it 's worth that much money how about 105 .
hi . Hello , I am interested in your speakers for sale . I am asking for $ 600 .
Yes , they are . Great . The listing says 2 but I only see 1 . Is there anything I should know about the second chair . Are there any defects ? The second chair is in the same exact condition . I just wanted to have a clear picture of one to show the details well .

How long have you had it ? Any wre cks or any damage to the bike ? Nope , no accidents at all . Just normal use . Like I stated I work at a bike shop so I 'm able to maintain it really well . It 's mint . What 's the absolute lowest you 'd be willing to take for the bike ?
Hi I am interested but have a few questions , to start , what is the laundry situation ? Hello , there are on site laundry facilities and a new laund rom at just opened up nearby . So it is coin laundry ? Do you the cost per load ?
It is definitely the same one with comments from buyers on am azon . Will you take 95 ? I am wanting to get rid of this quickly but feel that is just too low , 115 is my final offer . We can meet in the middle that would be fair . 107 .
Being that I recently graduated college I do understand how money can be tight , but unfortunately that is a bit too low for me to part with them . If you are willing to come up some in price , or could throw something else in , we may be able to work something out . How about $ 32 since they do look like they are in pretty good condition ? I 'll be willing at $ 70 . For $ 35 per chair .
Well it is 2 wd , so nothing major off road . I see that it is b anged up on the side . Is there any other damage ? No , nothing more then your standard wear and tear .
No sorry it is too much . Make me a different offer then . 174 .
That 's just too high for me . Are you sure ? $ 700 is more than fair . Can you tell me anything more about the bike that will convince me of that ? All I see is a 2009 aluminum frame , the cr anks et , and the handle bars and stem .

Is it in good condition and has it been in any accidents ? It 's in really good condition , runs just fine with no problems at all . We maintained it very well , always on time and it even has a new transmission so that can 't give you any problems either . What 's the mileage on it ?
Hello . Are you interested in the bike ? I sure am . I must ask though , how long have you had it ?
HI , i 'm interested in your Civic . When did you get it ?
it 's a steal at 35 00 bucks . you won 't see this deal again . Really ? The previous ad is for a 2012 for $ 3000 and it has all the same features plus lists new brakes and tires . Also , according to Blue Book it is only wor h 1500 .
No major accidents or failures of any of the systems . It 's in great shape . It 's got a lot of upgrades and it 's in really good shape . It runs sn ooth and quiet and is very reliable . How does $ 130 50 sound ? It 's all most new with only 23 556 miles on it and it 's only a year old . How about going up to 13 , 500 ?
Top of the m ern in to ya . How are you doing this fine day ?
Okay . Now this is a bit out of my price range budget wise . I 'm a professional artist so anything I can save is choice . Is it at all possible to rent this unit for 800 . Compar able apartments in the area are running at around 850 . I am sorry but I could not go lower than $ 12 50 on this high end proper t . It is also close to the downtown area , with amenities . All I can do is 1000 a month other than that it won 't be possible for me , especially with the parking fee as well .
I don 't really need delivery . I can give you $ 230 and be at your doorstep in 15 minutes . $ 230 is agreeable to me . Sounds like a deal ! great !

I 'm afraid that 's a bit too much for what you are asking for . I think 560 would work well . I am not eager to see it go for 560 . This is a great MT B . But i will part with it if you are willing to get to 680 but that is the absolute lowest . I think 640 would be the highest I could go .
That is a nice ch andel ier you have . Thanks its great . Are you interested ?
Park ing is about $ 40 which will grant you parking access for the duration for the year . Is the apartment furnished ? A couple of chairs and a table are already provided , you can reference the photo shown to see what they look like .

Hello , I am very interested in this home ! I do want to be honest with you though , it is above my budget . Hi there . Well the price is just right to what you 're getting . Look at the listing , its just a fair price . The market has so many expensive ones and we know that too . I have looked at listings and you have quite a lot of competitors for less monthly . Your home is closest to my job which is why I am so interested . I plan to live in the area for at least 3 years so I was wondering what the monthly rate would be for a 36 month lease ? The list price says its for 12 month lease .
that 's way way low than what I am asking for . Its fully serv iced and in a great condition . I can give it to you for 2500 . yeah but the company does not exist , and the car is 15 years old . parts are difficult to get in the event something goes wrong . How about 1500 ? 1800 its fair common . Its a whole car not just some parts .

Hello , I seen your rug posted and I am very int rest ed in it . Are there any noticeable signs of wear ? Not too bad . It is a bit fur led at the edges . I see . Well generally 500 is kind of a premium price on r ugs of this style . Do you have any room on the price ?
I have had it about 2 years . What ages is this appropriate for ? it is recommended for ages 4 to 8 .
Yes , I 'm not sure is this the latest model . Just checking . I 've got a few other items for sale . It 's not the latest but I kept it in pristine condition . Since it is not new , I would like to offer you half of the list price .
hi . Would you like to make an offer on the Back Pain solution ? how does it work .
It is 1 bedroom and runs about 700 square feet . The apartment is in a great location , close to everything social . That 's pretty big , but I can 't afford that much . Could you go down if I have good credit ? We can offer one free month if you were to move in within the next 30 days . Would that help your budget at all ?
That photo looks like it 's already set up . No it is not set - up that is the factory picture . What you will receive is in a closed box that has never been opened . I see well all in all then this is still an older model as the gear s 3 is now out so Id like to offer 161 for this model in white .
I am interested in the tooth brush . How is the box ? Any damage ?

Yes I believe so . But I don 't want to go too low . It really is an exceptional item . It does look fabulous , does it have any cracks in it ? None at all . It 's absolutely as good as new . We took very good care of it .
I do still have the phone for sale ! I see the screen is cracked which is a b ummer . Yes it is everything works fine though and I also will include a free screen as long as you can get it put on . I paid 30 dollars for that by itself .

100 I don 't know , I 've already lowered the price so it could sell faster because I need the money for remod eling . It 's worth a lot more than 120 . You could sell today $ 100 cash . No that 's not enough , how about I go down to 110 ?
Ok 15 50 but i pay 27 50 ? amount entered would be 27 50 . Ok how about i offer you 1700 and you take it ?
I have it set at 250 dollars , but I am willing to lower it a bit for you . I have $ 175 in cash on me right now . I . How bout 200 and I will deliver it to you , so you can come up with more cash ?

Yes it is brand new , sealed in retail box still : ). It sounds good , although I do believe the models with recharge able batteries are superior . Coin batteries are often expensive and difficult to find . Will you accept $ 25 ? I can pick up immediately . Actually the coin batteries allow this to have a smaller size so it 's very compact . It 's worth 35 . I can maybe lower it to 30 if that helps you out .
Hey this is a great place in a great neighborhood . Hi I would like to offer $ 11 50 for the Dup lex , I can move in tomorrow and pay in cash .
I would be interested in purchasing the wifi webcam for how about 25 dollars ? Unless you 're throwing in some Jack Daniel 's , too , the lowest I can go is $ 35 . I will throw in a bottle of generic 5 dollar whiskey on top of 27 dollars for the Motorola Wi - Fi Pet Video Camera .
This is old stuff though . 25 dollars is kind of high . I was looking to spend maybe 10 . These charg ers are all in great condition and you would be paying this price for just one elsewhere . Here you are getting two for that price . Can you come down a little on the price ?
is the tri ke still available ?
just would like to know if it has any d ings or scratches ? It is in great condition , and does not have any damages ! Would you like to purchase this fine piece of equipment ! How about $ 10 ?
Hey ! Saw your listing for the 2 mag na bikes and would be interested in them for my kids . Looks like a little damage on them though . Would you be able to part with them for $ 15 ?
I can offer an extended warrant on top of a quality assurance warranty and have spare set of tires in addition to an erg onomic seat pad . That 's great . Would you be willing to sell it for $ 900 if I pick it up and don 't require a test ride ? That 's a little below what I was looking for . Would you settle for $ 950 ?

Based on your friendly approach and speaking manner , I will lose my margin money also now . Since I don 't want to leave you , I come down to $ 13 00 and believe you 'll utilize this opportunity . Since parking isn 't included which will probably cost over 100 because of the great location and utilities cost over 200 dollars a month , I cannot put down more on rent when some things are included . I 'll do 1 125 but that 's the highest I can go . I have to eat too . Let us make the parking charge free of cost for you and final ize this deal for $ 13 00 . Ag ree ?
I have one I am selling . oh sorry , I am the buyer ! Would you accept $ 1000 ? I can come by today ! it has many new gadgets on it including tires and brakes , so I would not go any lower than $ 1200 .
Yes , this a pet friendly community . Are utilities included ? As in what ? The house comes with appliances .
$ 37 00 plus utilities . Wow ! Any way to get that closer to 2500 ? For a 2 year lease , I could drop to $ 3 200 . We include garden maintenance for free .
hi I am interest e din the bike . Awesome ! Please hold for a moment while I complete a sale . I have a limited budget and not a lot of time ... I wanted to make an offer of 850 .

Well , it is a great place ! Single family , great schools in the neighborhood . If I wanted the property would you be willing to partition one of the rooms ? Sure , I would be able to do that !

Hi ! I am interested in buying this sofa . Can you give me some details on it ?
I am supposed to go no lower than 350 ( this is according to my wife ) she will probably be so mad at me if I don 't get at least that , what do you say ? I can go up to 315 . D ang what if we call it 330 and I will throw in the extra 20 so I don 't get in trouble and then also I will give you some books on BM X stuff ? They teach you all types of neat things about riding and other things , are you interested ?
I could work that out if you want delivery . That sounds great . I only have $ 80 to spend . Would you consider $ 80 ? That 's really too low for me if I am going to also deliver them for you .

It 's quiet , but a couple blocks down there 's a small shopping center with a market and other stores . Well , I think the best I could do for an 1100 square foot apartment would be $ 750 . 750 is far too low . It 's going for 15 83 . 1440 with free parking .
They are only slightly worn . I just changed them maybe 3 months ago . Is something wrong with it and that 's why you are selling it ? Nothing is wrong with the bike at all . I have gotten a bit bigger and I am not riding it as much . I need money to save up for a new one that will fit me .
Hey there . These apartments are going fast . $ 15 83 . Wow , that seems kind of expensive . And how much is the parking ? The parking is an extra fee of 150 . I can give you the parking for free and the unit I can reduce to 15 50 .
Hi ! Are you interested in the night stand I 'm selling ? how old is this . It is new . The only issue is that the top drawer sticks a little bit and requires effort to open and close .
Hi are you interested in my living space ? Hello . I am interested . Can we negotiate on price though . $ 1900 is over my budget . For sure but I might not be approved to drop the price too low . How does 1600 sound to you ? If you can do this then I could remove the fees for 1 month when you first move in , does that sound good ?
I don 't know at the moment , but its a super clean car , clean title and less than a year old . Will ing to negotiate a little . Awesome . If I pay in cash could you come down on the price a little . Maybe around 9 , 500 ? I dont really want to go much under $ 10 , 000 . But if you pay cash I will deliver it to you for $ 97 50 .
How about you remove the high speed internet , all appliances and the dish washer and crown mold ing and i pay 1700 . lol remove you can give me 23 99 . 99 . sorry i cant afford that right now . I just need the home i dont need the stuff in it . How about you hire someone to remove the stuff and i pay for removal and you give me the place for 15 50 .

hello , can you please give me some information on the set ? Sure . It is a b ist ro ( extra tall ) table , with two stool height chairs . But the table is big enough that if you wanted to add two more chairs it would be comfortable for 4 to d ine . That seems like what I am looking for . I would be willing to offer you $ 75 dollars for the set !
Yeah the black wrap looks pretty sweet to be honest . Well I really want to buy the car from you . Would you be willing to let her go for 12 000 ? I have student loans to pay off , and $ 12 , 000 will not allow me to pay them off . This car has top - of - the - line amenities , how about $ 18 , 000 ? Yeah student loans suck . I can $ 17 , 500 with cash in hand today .
That 's great ! Would you take $ 6 for them ? I was asking $ 10 , if you are willing to pick them up I can do $ 6 . Could you actually deliver ? I 'd be willing to pay $ 7 if you could !
I guess I can squeeze another 150 . We won 't be able to eat and the kids will have to go bare foot but at least we 'll have a nice roof over our heads . The res always ram en noodles . You 're very funny . I 'll accept 3 , 150 .
Hi , is the bike still available ?

Its comes with 4 matching glasses , a silver tray , & a stainless steel thermal . i can go for 125 . Are you willing to pick up the item ?
Oh okay , it supports multiple devices , and is from the latest generation for apple devices , what 's up ? Will it support a apple laptop ? Oh definitely , both with wifi and c abled capabilities . I 'll throw in the cables if you want , $ 65 and we 're square ?
It has about 120 k miles on it . Just serv iced 20 miles ago , with new fluids , new tires , fresh battery . It has GPS navigation , premium surround sound , and backup camera . Never smoked inside of it or had pets inside , interior is super clean . Im looking for around $ 75 00 for it . can you offer near that ? Unfortunately , not even close . Which is absurd . If it is okay by you I am going to throw you my final offer so neither of us has to waste too much time on this . As I quite doubtful we can reach a good agreement due to my budget . Would that work for you ? If we 're talking bare minimum to help a friend out . $ 55 00 . im sorry i cant go any lower I should nt even go that low , its a steal at that rate .
Hey there , we have a nice condo here , you 're interested ? i am extremely interested ! but the price is just a bit too steep . I am still leasing my current apartment and am paying rent there as well , but i would love to move in as soon as possible . Is it possible that we can lower the price to $ 119 7 ? If so , i could absolutely give a down payment as soon as this negotiation is over ! Can 't go lower than 1500 , as there is a pool as well as appliances being included in the asking price .
Well how about something like 1950 ? I keep a clean house , my family is not loud , and I have been told Im a good neighbor to have . i wont come lower than 23 00 . Then Im afraid we cannot make a deal sorry .
yes , can i get it for $ 45 . Will that be cash ? yes .
Hey I 'm interested in your antique Black berry charger . Are you willing to negotiate if I come pick it up today ?

If you pick the set up I can sell it for $ 75 . Hmm , how about 50 and I 'll throw in a free dinner for two at a restaurant I own ? What 's the name of your restaurant ?
I 'd like to offer you $ 94 for it . The phone is in great condition , and I feel that it is worth more than that . Okay , what do you feel it 's worth then ?
Hmm , I am a bit flexible on the price , but this truck is in near mint condition . What price were you thinking of ? I think I would let it go for $ 11 , 200 .
I can bring it but in next two weeks not anytime soon . What if I could come by today and pick it up ? okay then I will accept the 40 .
Okay . I see that you are listing it at 300 . However , I can buy a new one for that . Honestly , without any sort of warranty available and the fact that it is used - I can do 150 . it actually still has over 10 months of the warranty that comes with the bike when you buy it . I will not go as low as 150 . I can do 225 though . Usually a warranty doesn 't transfer if you sell it . I can do 200 .
OK . So looking at new models of this bike , I see they sell for about $ 13 00 . $ 1200 seems a bit high , but you have taken great care of it . Would you be willing to consider an offer of $ 900 cash and I will come and pick it up ? I would consider a thousand , if you can come and pick it up , don 't forget I added more stuff compared to the new ones on the market . That 's true . OK , let 's agree on $ 1000 and I 'll head over this afternoon to pick up the bike .
I see your interested in my lamp bar !
There 's a park nearby , and the neighborhood is friendly . Wow ! This looks great ! Are you looking to sign a one year lease ? This is a great home for families , and the 2 car garage is a bonus .

Hello . I am interested . Can we negotiate on price though . $ 1900 is over my budget . For sure but I might not be approved to drop the price too low . How does 1600 sound to you ? If you can do this then I could remove the fees for 1 month when you first move in , does that sound good ? Ok ! I can agree on $ 1600 with no fees for the first month . Im excited !
Wow what a cool lamp you have for sale ! How much are you asking for it ? Yes , Isn 't cool . I am asking $ 65 for it . O uch , I was thinking more like $ 30 since it has some wear from its old age and being used so much .
oh okay , how cracked is the screen ? Its a pretty big crack but the phone itself still works . oh okay . I was thinking $ 4 0 is a good price .
Not on the site but there is a couple of them within a few blocks . Oh darn , that 's sort of inconvenient . Could you come down on the price a little since I 'll have to travel to the laund rom at and pay for the coin machines ? I was thinking $ 15 50 . Yeah , that 'd be a little too low for us . We could do 2100 and throw in free internet .
I can 't . I 've reached my upper limit . Will it be cash in hand if I say yes ? Yes . We can meet tomorrow .
It is in great condition . It is hardly used . I think 700 dollars might be a little too steep of a price for this couch . Could you possibly lower the price down to 500 ? Would you be able to take it right away ?
I can see that . how old is it ? what is the condition ? Its around 40 year a old , it came from my Grand mas house . Considering the age its in really good shape . that pretty old but I am still interested . would you take $ 450 for it ?

They look great . I can 't tell from the photo though , is there any rust ? No rust at all , super sturdy too ! Great . I would like to come see them in person . If I was able to come by today and pick them up would you be willing to come down on the price , say $ 90 ?
Classic ? Did you do some customization or detailing ? Not sure I can justify going over 25 if not . Yep . I build this custom for myself . The only thing that is Schw inn is the frame . And is the before they sold old frame , so you know it is a good one . Custom for yourself , aw , will you miss it ? Well 27 is the highest I can go .
I would . I will come down to 3 , 300 . I just transferred to the state and I have a lot of money tied up in moving expenses so my budget is tight would you consider 3 , 000 ? I would , but just a little more . How about 3 , 150 .

It can fit five people in it . I was hoping to find something with less miles on it but i could buy one with 160 k for $ 2 , 000 . Would you accept that offer ? I think we can find a middle ground here pretty easy , could you come pick it up ? I 'd take 2500 for it if you could .
I think 20 is a fair price considering I originally paid 99 $ for it . what if I come pick it up ? It is also now used with some marks on it . Ok then I will take 18 if 2 $ is that big of a deal to you .
I am loving that bike . Can you tell me a little more about it ? Well I bought it a few years ago for my son but he is too big for it so it basically has been sitting in my garage . It is in great shape , no damage .
Hi ! I am interested in you car . Is it still available ?
I see maybe there is a compromise . If you only want the truck without any of the tools then I can let it go for 8 500 or something like that ? Okay that sounds great . My budget is 80 49 . Okay so you want just the truck for , can you do 8 100 so it is even ?
Ok , that sounds good . My kid is 11 so he could easily get at least one year riding . What is the least you 'll take for it ? Well I want someone else 's kid to enjoy this bike too . So I 'll throw in his tire infl ator we bought , and our old bike lock , all for 90 . That 's a good deal . Will you deliver it ?

need a bike . I do . I was wondering if you 'd consider $ 110 .
No , I always used seat covers and no smoking or pets in the vehicle . It ; s going to go quick at just 13 000 . i agree its a great truck , but with the way off road packages go its hard on the transmission and if nothing has been replaced it will all start to needing replacing in the next year or 10 k miles . why are you selling ? New baby on the way otherwise it would stay .
Does it work real well . I have an older router and need to get a new one because my router broke . yes , it works very well . I have never had any problems with it . Can you do 57 dollars for it . I had to pay a few bills and that 's what I have left . I need this router for my work .
Does it have a self timer on it where it takes photos on its own ? To be honest , I 've never used the timer option on it , so I 'm not entirely sure . The amount of time I used it was mainly for casual photography . Oh ok can you do 161 ?
As in what ? The house comes with appliances . Am I responsible to pay monthly utility fees ; such as : water , electricity , garbage ? Those are included in the listing price .
Hello , I am inter sted in the I phone 6 . Will I be able to use it on any network ? Hi , this is a great deal for this  iph one . Complete ly unlocked , yes any network . Are there any problems with it ?
Well , I was wondering about the location and the number of bedrooms . How many people can it sleep comfortably ? This is a dual master so that means it has two master bedrooms . You could fit 3 in each bed so 6 people total . Well it would just be my wife and me . It will be nice to have the guest room too . We have no pets . Everything else about it sounds great , except that we have to commute to the city for work . We were thinking something more along the $ 2500 - 28 00 range for a suburban home .
how old are they are they scratched up ? They 're old enough to qualify as vintage but they 're in good condition . No scratches . I would like to offer you 335 . 00 for them and I can pick them up this Saturday .

Hi . I am interested in the bunk beds . These bunk beds are great with free matt resses , no pill ows and sheets , excellent condition . I 'm not in need of the matt resses , and I was wondering if we could work on a deal that we can both agree on ? $ 290 is just way out of my range .
I am great thanks ! I like your bike ! It is a wonderful bike I 'm moving and will be commuting by subway so i need to get rid of it . Do you have any questions ? I was hoping I could offer $ 125 for it . How old is it , and are there any flaws I need to know about your bike .
$ 700 is more than fair . Can you tell me anything more about the bike that will convince me of that ? All I see is a 2009 aluminum frame , the cr anks et , and the handle bars and stem . It has Shim ano Dev ore XT cr anks et , R itchie 's Comp handle bars and stem , Av id Ju icy 7 Hydro lic Disc Bra kes . These are all high end components .
Awesome is there anything specific you would like to know about it . Are any utilities included in the rent ? Yes all utilities are included .
Hello there .
I really only need 2 . None of the 2 bedrooms are that low , are you willing to pay 1800 ? wow that is still a bit much . Is there anyway if I sign a 2 year lease you could come down to 1400 ? I could manage that .
That BMW sure looks interesting . I 'm looking to buy for around $ 3000 .
The foam is good . There is no d ents in the cushion . Can you do $ 75 ? I really can 't go less then $ 100 but I can deliver it to you today .

We have all thee options available right now , although at this time we only have a couple of 3 bedroom apartments . How many bedrooms are you looking for ?

I 'll tell you what I can go 2100 for this car . She 's my baby , so I 'm a little higher than that on price . She 's still got plenty of life left on her . How about I throw in my snow tires that I was going to sell separately , and we call it 3 200 ?
Well , since I can 't see the item , how about I come up and check it out and if I deem it sound enough , i 'll pay $ 40 ? How does that sound ? That sounds fair . great !

Oh yes , like the ad says , it came to us a total mess . But with new chain , hydro lic disk breaks , a new seat and tires , the bike rides like a champ . I 'm asking $ 250 for it and its well worth that price . That is a little high for me . Would you take $ 215 ? This is an amazing bike , you will see if you come out and give it a test ride . I 'm only willing to go so low . A lot of work has been put into it . $ 240 is the lowest .
Hi ! I see you are interested in our Lux ury apartment ! It has a lot of great features that will make even the relaxed tenants want to celebrate ! Well I would love to become a tenant . I see you have 200 dollars off right now , but I don 't need the granite counter tops . If I volunteered to lived on one of the floors with Form ica , how does 28 35 a month sound ? That s not a bad idea ! But with all of our outstanding features , I would love to see you living in this apartment for $ 29 00 a month . We have massive soaking tub s , water saving shower heads , and high speed internet that will keep those precious kid Os happy all day !
It wasn 't my style , it was a gift . I prefer more of the band style watches as opposed to a normal watch look . ah , fair enough . tell you what ? I 'll give you 140 for it , and i 'll come and take it up off your hand . deal ? Well , thats more than $ 100 off my asking price . How about $ 185 ?
It 's black with some blue details and white letter ing . Great . I would love to have it . But the price is holding me back . Is there a room for negotiation ? What would you be able to offer ?

Hey there !
its one bedroom do you know the interior color . It 's all painted in be ige right now . You can make changes to it as you please as long as it 's back to standard once you move out . 1600 .

However , the frame does allow for both a trailer and a second seat for a passenger . Great ! How about $ 720 ? I can do $ 740 and throw in the tire pump , a spare tire , and the yet - to - be installed head l amp .
how we doing partner .
Hi do you still have the Volvo ?
Thanks for your interest . I would love to have the phone but is it free from any financial obligations ?
That 's great . How long have you been riding ? This bike is for advanced riders . I 've been riding for a couple years now . I see the listing mentions its for big people . So does it not work for kids ? It would be good for large teenagers who are over 5 ' 4 " but not smaller than that . Younger children won 't be able to reach the pedd les . However , the frame does allow for both a trailer and a second seat for a passenger .
Okay that sounds great . My budget is 80 49 . Okay so you want just the truck for , can you do 8 100 so it is even ? okay then we got the deal 8 100 .

I rep ur posed them , and now they are in nice shape ! I 'm asking $ 100 for the two chairs and table . They look great . I can 't tell from the photo though , is there any rust ? No rust at all , super sturdy too !
N ope ! Again , it 's only been used twice , so the condition is close to perfect . I 'm just looking to get rid of it ASAP . How does $ 800 sound ? That 's way too much for me . I understand it 's in good condition but it is a bit dated . How about $ 500 ? Since you want 500 and I want 800 , let 's meet in the middle at 650 . That way it 's fair and we both get what we want . For 660 , I 'll deliver it to you tomorrow .
Hello there . Hello how are you doing today ? I 'm doing well , are you here for the listing ?

Hi , I would like to purchase this bike for $ 350 . that is quite a low offer this bike is in great condition it is just a little to big for me . It 's a little too big for me as well . I am 5 ' 11 " and will use it lightly to get from point A to B . I don 't think $ 800 is enough for a 24 lb aluminum bike , especially one from 8 years ago .
Other apartments in that area are much lower in price is there any way you could lower the price for me ? We can work with you a little on the price , but it has to be reasonable . Can you come down to 1200 ?
No , it 's a year old and hasn 't been used because it 's bigger than I expected it to be . It 's been in storage . no chip or scr at ce hs . This seems like it will fit perfectly on my patio space . I would love to come by and see it . Sure , when would be a good time ?

Yes , the chim ney has been serv iced regularly . Ok great . Does it come with was her , dry er , dish washer , fridge ? This listing only comes with a was her and dry er .

I am ! I see that you 're offering cash only in F ols om ... any chance you could go a little lower than your asking price if I came over in person , especially give the bike 's age ? Maybe 45 $ ? I know it 's a big ask . Yeah that 's quite a bit under my asking price . I could go $ 75 but it 's in really good condition and a cool bike to own . I was hoping for a little lower , just because it 's on the older end . I don 't have a ton to spend . How about 55 $ ?
great , its move in ready and listed at 2 172 a month . thats more than I can do right now how about 1500 ? sorry that is too low , lowest I could do is 2000 and waive half of the deposit .
I just brought it out for better lighting , it 's kept indoors . Oh . Is the price firm ? I would like it , but only have $ 225 available in cash . $ 225 if you can pick it up , that works for me .
Hi ! I 'm reading the ad still .
Would you be willing to lease it for $ 1 , 400 ? Would you be willing to bring it up to $ 1 , 500 ? I can do $ 1 , 500 if you include the parking fees .
D arn .. That 's going to be some extra money out of my pocket to bring my own fridge and dish washer . Can we lower the price some ? I 'd be willing to negotiate . What 's your offer ? $ 2 , 500 is what I was thinking .
It 's in excellent condition , very well kept . No problems at all . Sounds good . Can you work with me on the price ? Sure I can work with you on the price a little bit .

It is a very reliable car . It does have higher miles , however Toyota 's are very well known for lasting . I 'm not able to accept $ 2 , 100 , that is too low , less than half of what I 'm asking .
Hi there , saw your ad for the entertainment center . It looks like it 's in good shape , how old is it ?
No , they have never been used . The item is brand new in sealed packaging . Will you take $ 25 ? 25 is a little low . I could do 30 $. I paid over 50 $ for it , so this is a good deal .

I 'm not sure exactly , I believe it is pine . Okay , Would you take $ 18 for it ? I think 20 is a fair price considering I originally paid 99 $ for it .

How about the paint how is it ? The paint is beautiful and if you 're willing to pay close to my asking price then I can offer a coupon from my friend who runs a local paint shop and you will be able to change the color if you would like to , how does that sound ? Well Im not sure on paying that much for a 43 year old vehicle . I am sure 61 k is not original I am sure from my expertise on cars that is rolled over so that makes the value drop . I can offer $ 24 50 and come now to get it .
