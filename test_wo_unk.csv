Hello I am interested in this bike,intro
"It would be good for large teenagers who are over 5'4"" but not smaller than that. Younger children won't be able to reach the peddles. However, the frame does allow for both a trailer and a second seat for a passenger",disagree
Great! How about $720?,init-price
"I can do $740 and throw in the tire pump, a spare tire, and the yet-to-be installed headlamp",counter-price
"Hi there, are you interested in the bike?",intro
Yes I am. What condition is the bike in?,inquiry
"excellent condition, barely used at all.",inform
"I see this bike is worth about $160 new, so your asking price is too high.",init-price
I think you are mistaken this model is much more new. I am just asking $150.,counter-price
"I just checked and it's the same exact model selling for $160 new on ebay and amazon. Used they are like $80, will you take 80?",counter-price
"no way, and like I said not possible for this model. I say take your chance on there if you like, sounds like a scam. I can come down slightly to 125 but that is it.",counter-price
It is definitely the same one with comments from buyers on amazon. Will you take 95?,counter-price
"I am wanting to get rid of this quickly but feel that is just too low, 115 is my final offer.",counter-price
We can meet in the middle that would be fair. 107,counter-price
Hello.,intro
That's awesome. I could use it in the office that I am setting up. I'm on a tight budget though. Can you take $30 for it?,init-price
"Well, friend, that's just too low, this has 360 degree coverage with full duplex operation and echo suppression. It's frankly a steal at $50, I'm crazy for letting it go at that price!",counter-price
Hello. How is the condition of this bike?,intro
How much was it used?,inquiry
I used it only for occasional weekend rides with my family down our neighborhood streets.,inform
Did you purchase it brand new? Or buy it used?,inquiry
It was brought brand-new 2 years ago.,inform
"I am somewhat interested in it, but was really planning more of the $100 range. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at at $115?",init-price
Hi there. I'm interested in the chair. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $50?,init-price
I think 65 is a pretty fair price because it's in really good condition and they are very high quality. I can go down to 60. Would that work for you?,counter-price
"I can't, I don't really have the money right now, but I could use another chair in my dining room. What about $55 then?",counter-price
Sorry but 60 is the lowest I can take for these since they are worth more than that.,counter-price
But they are used. It's only $10 dollars less. I only have $55 to offer.,counter-price
Yes they are used but new ones go for three times that $60 is my final offer,insist
Nope. $55. I think you are just being hard on me. I can't afford to go higher and you need to get rid of them. I can pick them up from you myself if that helps.,insist
Hey there,intro

"Hey there, are you interested in the Lexus?",intro
"Nice, well it only has around 120k miles, all the amenities, so those are great, and I have the title. What's your budget?",inquiry
I'd like to spend as little as possible.  Has it ever been in a accident?,inquiry
"A minor fender-bender, but it's since been repaired, so it's unnoticeable. The Bluebook value on this car is 10k.",init-price
Would that be the new blue book value or used blue book value?,inquiry
"Used, it's mostly because it's a Lexus with all the amenities and add-ons. I figure it's decent to give it for 7500 because of the history of a fender bender",counter-price
Do you have all of the service records for it?,inquiry
"Yup, and the title",inform
I can offer you 5200 cash,counter-price
"I need 6000, is that in your price range?",counter-price
6000 is abit above my prince range.  I'm sure the accident is not noticeable but I really can go no more than 5250,counter-price
I'm sorry I already made the final offer. I need 6000 minimum because of all the add-ons purchased and the work from the accident.,insist
I thought you said it was a minor fender bender? How much work was done on it from the accident.  And what type of add-ons?,inquiry
"Like from the original purchase price, if I were to give it to you for 5k, that's the cost of a Yaris with no camera, gps navigation, and the couple hundred dollars I sunk into getting the fender bender professionally fixed.",counter-price
"Oh, it has a camera?  Is that a back-up camera?",inquiry
"Yup, it has a nice back-up camera so you never hit anything, decent included sound system as is with Yaris, the moonroof/sunroof all work and were barely used, as well as the power liftgate/power windows",inform

And you have two of them?,inquiry
yes the price is for the pair of them together. :),inform
Would you be able to take 50 for them?,init-price
"That price is too low for me, they are in excellent condition so the listed price is already a good deal.",vague-price
I know it's just a tight budget I have right now. I'd be able to go up to $58 if that's possible,counter-price
Okay I can help you out a little. 60 and we got a deal.,counter-price
Hello. Has this item been used previously?,intro
165 is out of my budget. Would you accept 130 for it?,init-price

"HOI,give me a moment, reading description",intro
Is this item brand new in box?,inquiry
"Yes it is brand new, sealed in retail box still :)",inform
"It sounds good, although I do believe the models with rechargeable batteries are superior. Coin batteries are often expensive and difficult to find. Will you accept $25? I can pick up immediately.",init-price
Actually the coin batteries allow this to have a smaller size so it's very compact. It's worth 35. I can maybe lower it to 30 if that helps you out.,counter-price
30 is acceptable to me. Thank you.,counter-price
"Hey there, id love to buy your couch, what can you tell me about it? What price are you looking for, and is it in really good condition, or very used?",intro
Hello! Asking price is $700. It is in excellent condition. It was in our finished basement and barely used.,init-price

that's still way above my range. can you do 2750? that's the max i can go,counter-price
I think we're a ways off. The lowest I'm willing to go is 3000 with the tires.,counter-price
it's a steal at 3500 bucks. you won't see this deal again,init-price
"Really? The previous ad is for a 2012 for $3000 and it has all the same features plus lists new brakes and tires. Also, according to Blue Book it is only worh 1500",counter-price
"toyota's and hondas don't go by kbb. they last forever. and this car was maintained meticulously. that previous ad might have a salvage title. this is a clean title. no dings, no defects of any kind. and all power",disagree
"it has 150,000 miles on it. Even if it was maintained perfectly that's a lot of miles. I only need a starter car for my kid so this would be a good one if the price was right. I can go up to 1750 but that's near the limit.",counter-price
"well yes, but mostly highway miles. wear on the car is very little considering. and 1750 won't buy this car. might try another car.",disagree

"OK, Because it is old technology, I am only willing to pay $10. Can you accept that?",init-price

I can only pay $13. My final offer.,counter-price
"Hi, I am short on cash, but need the drawer chest.  Can you take $40 if I come pick it up today.  Cash!  Deal?",init-price
"The chest was $120 brand new, and I think $40 is far too low.  I can certainly sell it to someone else for my asking price of $75--a bargain!",counter-price
"Yes, but the chest is used and that knocks at least 50% off the price.  How about $50?",counter-price
I am not certain 50% off is accurate.  Have you ever bought a used car or house?  How about $65?,counter-price
"Yes I have bought both used before.  Honestly, I just cannot afford the price.  I just moved and I have had to pay a lot of costs plus a deposit.  I need somewhere to put my clothes.  Can you do $65?",agree

That sounds fair. How about 1800? Does that sound fair to you?,counter-price
"I mean, it's a little over my budget, but with the fenced backyard and the easy commute to work, I think that's a good price.  Additionally, in a few months my wife will be back to work, so we'll only have the extra financial stress for a short time, hopefully.  I can do $1800.",agree
