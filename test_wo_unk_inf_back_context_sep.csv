They were recently replaced and are in excellent shape. Ok - is this a 10, 12, 18 or 21 speed? This is a 21 speed. It is difficult to see from the one picture - does this have disc brakes? It has Avid Juicy 7 Hydraulic Disc Brakes. would you consider anything for trade? Not at this time, but if it helps I'd be willing to deliver the bike to you and allow you to try it out.

I have 5000 cash I can give you tomorrow. I have to stick to the 10999, but I can throw in a tank of gas and 1 year of sirius xm radio service (I will prepay for it).

If yes, I will come up with 7500 tops.  That is a deal or no deal price for me. I can't do that.  But based on the year your local credit union would issue you a small loan for the balance.

I see interesting tell you what i can give you $96 cash tomorrow for the lamp and i can pick it up. 96 is a bit below what I'm comfortable with accepting. Tell you what. 120 and I'll throw in this very cool light bulb I found for it. Ah no need for a light bulb I intend to use a dynamic color changing Phillips led in it. Gonna go great for setting up an intimate mood with my special someone. Well that's ok but I still can't go under 120. It's already a 40 dollar drop so I think it's very fair. Ok then how about 99? I go down 40 but you come up by 3? Doesn't seem too reasonable though. Well it is a used lamp also I'm working with a budget plus come on it doesn't look like it's worth that much money how about 105. Well I believe it's worth 160 so asking you for 120 is already a good deal. My absolute lowest is 115 and that's really just take it or leave it. I can't give it away. . You drive a hard bargain really can't offer anything to sweeten the deal? I tried to but you weren't interested. I can only offer you the fact that you won't regret buying it. It's a really cool piece. Alright then man I'm gonna have to pass thank you for your time though I'm sure you will find the right buyer soon. No problem. Thanks.","Hello. Hey I'm pretty interested in the lamp looks really good. Thank you for your interest. Any questions I can answer for you? How long have you had it and are there any damages or scratches also is the shade very secure on the lamp? It's in almost perfect condition. Had it for a few months, but it just doesn't fit anywhere in my space. Fits perfectly together though. Makes it unique. I see did you purchase it new? Yes, got it new. It's a danish modern style with a vintage feel. Really awesome and unique.

Are there any chips in the paint or rust on it? Nope! Again, it's only been used twice, so the condition is close to perfect. I'm just looking to get rid of it ASAP. How does $800 sound? That's way too much for me. I understand it's in good condition but it is a bit dated. How about $500? Since you want 500 and I want 800, let's meet in the middle at 650.

Well I am offering 3300 for it per month for a 1 year lease. I am interested, and that is in the area I would like to be, but would you be willing to consider an offer of $2350 per month? I can leave the furniture and furnishings there for you to use.  Would that entice you to pay 2800? Yes, the furniture is a good deal as well.  Could we settle on 2700? Perhaps.  Are you willing to come and take a tour? Yes, I could do that this afternoon. <sep> Sounds good and if you like it we can do 2700 a month, dela?",agree

Alright, I'm going to tell you right out of the gate, my budget is very low. I'm looking at trying to spend around $2250. I can probably go higher but would have to be something very compelling to go higher... $2250 is way too low. This car is in good condition. No fading, rips, tears, no leaks and no check engine lights. It has a backup camera, and the air conditioning is perfect. The car was completely repaired and no trace of damage to the front fender. Oh wait... what do you mean ""repaired""? It was in an accident? That is no good... I'm not sure I want a car that has been in an accident... Yes, it shows in the ad. Another car hit mine in a parking lot and caused damage to the front left fender. But it was reapired and you could never tell. Oh wow. It doesn't say that in the ad I'm looking at. That makes a huge difference. There is really no way I can go over $2250 considering it was in an accident.","Hello, I am interested in the Prius  you have listed for sale...

"Hello, I'm interested in your bike that you have listed. Can you tell me more about it? Hello, It is the 2013 Ibis Mojo SLR, It is in excellent condition. I am looking for $1700. Would you like this? I am. How much has it been used? It has only been used a handful of times, I just do not get the opportunity to use it like I had hoped I would. Are there any problems with it? Major scratches or anything? Just one or two minor scratches. That is all. How does $1200 sound for it? That is way out of the ballpark I was asking for, The lowest I would be willing to go currently would be around $1500. I'll only pay $1500 if I get to ride it around for a little bit first.","Hello, I'm interested in your bike that you have listed. Can you tell me more about it?

Will do!!!","Hello. Thanks for viewing the listing. Nice truck. How many miles on it? 75000. You only put 75,000 miles on a 13 year old vehicle? Must not have used it much. Yes, it wasn't used much at all. It's going for 13000. I like the off-road tires, and it looks awesome but 13000 is a little high. I was hoping that you could let it go for 7000. It's still 13 years old. I apologize as I can't go to $7000. Could you do $10000? Its from 2004 and to get it up to emission standards is going to be a pain.

"Hello! I'm interested in your Toyota. It looks great. Is there anything wrong with it? The car runs as would be expected of a car of such mileage. No problems sir! Oh great! I see from the ad that it is very clean. Is there any damage? No damage. And it has passed the smog check. Great. What's the reason why you are trying to get rid of it? I am a dealer and I want another driver to have a great experience with this car. I see. How many miles are on the car? 170,000 and such 5700 is a more than fair price. That's quite a bit. Are you willing to negotiate for a lower price? of course. what is your budget like? I've been looking for a car ranging from 2.5K to 4K. I am looking at a few other cars too. Would 3K work for you? I will need 5000 to part ways with this one. But what we can do is that i can get 1000 down from you and the rest can be paid monthly. How about $3500 in cash today. If there are no issues after 3 months, I'll give you an extra $500? I just don't see it my friend. I cant make money off of that. It is in great condition. Ready to go. 4500 would be where we need to be at.","Hello! I'm interested in your Toyota. It looks great. Is there anything wrong with it? The car runs as would be expected of a car of such mileage.
